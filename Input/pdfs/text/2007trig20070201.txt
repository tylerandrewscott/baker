He confirmed that the TRMP will be a core guidance document. PSE is planning to model this TRMP after Snoqualmie’s process. As we develop detailed plans (ex: after land acquisition), we would send them as addendums to inform FERC that we are in compliance with the requirements we describe in the TRMP. This would allow us to minimize administrative overhead since we would not be re-filing the entire TRMP (or seeking approval) for each addition. BiOp Update: The current plan is for the Biological Opinion to be completed by the end of February. There is a field trip scheduled for Wednesday, February 7. Osprey / Loon Teamlet Update: The teamlet chose to place the Osprey platform on a snag across the lake from the boat launch. The teamlet then reviewed design options presented by Jennifer Blackburn (PSE Engineer), chose a design and discussed moorage and disturbance issues. They decided to place one of the three loon platform this year so they can see how the design performs before building and placing the other two. Elk Update: Mike Muller (RMEF) met with the heirs to the “initial parcel,” and reported that the meeting went very well. The parcels are not for sale unless the heirs need to sell part of them to pay estate taxes. They are, however, interested in conservation easements and have similar management interests. The teamlet also met Ray Croswell, RMEF’s new lands program manager, who will focus exclusively on Elk lands. TRMP Review Tony projected our January 4, 2007 draft on the screen and made live changes as we continued to walk through the document chapter by chapter, starting with the Post-Acquisition Habitat Assessment section of Chapter 4 (Elk). After completing Chapter 4, we skipped ahead to review Section 8.2, “Weed Management on Lands Acquired and/or Managed under Articles 502, 503, 504 and 505.” We discussed the funding implications of noxious weed presence on acquired lands and agreed that the intent of this section is to minimize the likelihood of surprise expenses that could eat up funding intended for our purposes. We will not be requiring higher weed management standards than are mandated by regulations unless it is in the overall interest of the TRIG to do so. After this discussion, we left the language as-is. We then returned to Chapter 5 and made it partially through that section. We will start next time at PostAcquisition Habitat Assessment.
