FERC’s latest schedule shows them targeting September for license issuance, but that will depend in part on the 401 process. At this point, PSE has anticipated (for budgeting purposes) implementing the license January 1, 2007, which would make 2007 “year 1” of the license. LAND ACQUISITION UPDATE Tom reported that the “initial property” owners aren’t responsive at this time, so we need to determine alternates. There are a limited number of land owners in our target area. Two of the largest private landowners are open to trading with us in order to “block up” their lands and eliminate isolated parcels. IDENTIFICATION OF ALTERNATE PARCELS We need to identify in more detail the properties we are most interested in. Tom will then go to the land owner to discuss trade possibilities. Tom described the process: We would acquire land (or options on land) adjacent to their current property, then trade that newly acquired property for land we want for elk. Terry shared that PSE’s due diligence will be fairly easy since the land we’d get in trade isn’t operational in nature (less likely to have contamination, etc.). The landowner would be responsible for due diligence on the newly acquired land that would be traded. PSE and RMEF will continue discussions to establish a working agreement for this land acquisition process. Tony distributed a map that showed the area we’re most interested in, and highlighted three potential parcels for discussion. We discussed the land owner’s interests, including their preference for land adjacent to their current land and that the trades be value for value, rather than acre for acre. There is apparently some competition with other conservation groups who are also interested in land preservation. We discussed the benefits and risks of coordinating our efforts with them. Since The Nature Conservancy is a signatory to the settlement we should discuss coordination of our land acquisition efforts with them. Tom will contact TNC, and Tony will contact Fayette Krause (TNC representative to the TRIG group) about coordination. Patrick will also talk with Fayette. Terry shared his concerns that the more we talk about our interests the greater the risk that the price will go up, or that someone could purchase a parcel we are interested in before we can. We then discussed the value of having confidentiality agreements in place in advance of such conversations. Tom shared that these transactions move quickly, especially when there is competition. We need to identify the property and the deal (trade arrangements) in advance; Tom will talk with Tony and Terry and need to get this group’s approval very quickly. The entire process needs to happen in 5-10 business days. We agreed that acquisition costs as negotiated by the group in the settlement can include a brokerage or acquisition fee in addition to the land purchase price. The fees will be paid from the land acquisition budget. IDENTIFICATION OF ALTERNATE PARCELS We discussed the benefits and concerns for the three parcels highlighted on the map handed out earlier, Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Elk Teamlet Meeting Notes, June 21, 2006  Page 2 of 4   and the possible management costs associated with buying land adjacent to landowners who have actively hazed elk off their lands. The group decided that at least preliminarily these three parcels fit the criteria for the initial acquisition and should be pursued. LAND ACQUISITION PLAN Marty distributed the Pre-Acquisition Assessment Form he updated based on feedback from our last meeting. Tony noted that we have money now, we’ll have another $1.25m in “year one” of the license (tentatively 2007), and another $1.25m in “year five.” We decided to move forward with pre-acquisition studies on the three highlighted properties, while maintaining an open relationship with the owner of the “initial parcel.” Tony proposed that Kathy (botanical) and Marty (wildlife and timber) review the sites, using the PreAcquisition Assessment Form handed out today, and when finished will email a completed form with a narrative summary of the property to Tony for distribution to the group. Tom will talk with the land owner to coordinate permission for Elk Teamlet members to walk the property. In the meantime, Tom will continue conversations with the landowner to identify the parcels they would want us to purchase for equivalent trade value. We discussed the possibility of tying up the three parcels we’re interested in (with short-term options?) while we study the properties for trade. If the preacquisition study of the three initial parcels is promising, Tom will request an option or right of first refusal with the land owner. OTHER: Tony reported that he will develop a spreadsheet to capture the costs associated with acquisition activities, and bring this spreadsheet to our next meeting for the group to review.
