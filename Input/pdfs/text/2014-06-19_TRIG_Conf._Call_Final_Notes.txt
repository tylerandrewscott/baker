Decision Item #1: Does the TRIG authorize PSE to proceed to negotiate and make an offer to acquire Property G for an amount not to exceed $300,000 <ad> contingent upon the resolution of titled access at no additional cost <ad> with the funding for this acquisition to come from the SA 503 Elk Habitat Acquisition Fund?  TRIG Discussion: During the June 5, 2014 TRIG meeting we had a discussion about making an offer on Property G. The TRIG reevaluated the parcel that it evaluated several years ago and agreed that it is still a good fit. After much dialogue about options and possible approaches, attendees came to agreement in principle about parameters for Joel Schleppi's next steps. Based on that discussion, Tony queued up a decision for today's conference call. Since the TRIG meeting, Joel has conducted a site visit to confirm that conditions on the ground haven't changed, and they have not since we made a previous offer on the property.  The conference call group discussed the property. Property G is the Goodyear Nelson property on Burpee Hill we made an offer on about 3 years ago. The owner's representative thinks the owners are more willing to sell at this time. It is 91 acres. In 2011 we authorized PSE's real estate agent to negotiate up to $260K to purchase the property. Now that we are three years later (almost 4 since the last appraisal), instead of doing a new appraisal we just decided in the TRIG meeting to save some money and assume about a 4% increase per year, and so now we have a proposed negotiation limit of $300K. TRIG members on the conference call were in support of this proposal. The decision is "Does the TRIG authorize PSE to proceed to negotiate and make an offer to acquire Property G for an amount not to exceed $300,000 <ad> contingent upon the resolution of titled access at no additional cost <ad> with the funding for this acquisition to come from the SA 503 Elk Habitat Acquisition Fund?  After a little more discussion we decided that it was time to take a vote, and there was consensus on the proposed decisions by those on the phone call (see Decisions section above for the specific decision). Brock  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT FERC PROJECT NO. 2150-033, 027  Terrestrial Resources Implementation Group Page 1 of 2   had e-mailed his vote (no opposition to the decision) in prior to the meeting. The decision was approved by consensus. Joel will proceed with negotiations and purchase of the property according to the parameters set out by today's decision. Have questions? Call Tony.
