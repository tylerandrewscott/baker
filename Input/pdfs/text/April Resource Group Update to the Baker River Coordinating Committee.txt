Our next Face-to-face meeting will be a joint ARG and BRCC meeting with a tour of new facilities June 8 at the Baker Lodge. We will send notices, directions and other information as the date approaches. We will continue to reserve the 4th Wednesday each month for a conference call or face to face meeting in case. Thanks, Cary April Update to BRCC: Aquatic Resource Group The ARG held a conference call/WebEx meeting on April 13th. PSE provided the latest updates on the Adult Fish Trap construction (recent construction photographs of the renovation were shown). They are making plans for testing. The facilities are planned to be in operation by June 1. Both the Upper Baker FSC and Lower Baker gulper are on-line for the season. They have been collecting migrating juvenile fish since the beginning of March. It is early in the migration season, so far several thousand fish have been recorded, mostly coho. PSE also presented pictures of the recent hatchery construction progress. These included the hatchery building piping and tanks in the early rearing room, crowders and screen assemblies for the outdoor AI adult holding raceways, the spawning area and installation of the 20K outdoor rearing circulars, raceways and net support systems. Normal fish production operations have been maintained and are doing well considering all the construction around the new hatchery. Beach 4 has produced nearly 2 million sockeye fry thus far and artificial incubation production has yielded 1.7 million sockeye eyed-eggs. Summary of other article implementation updates included a schedule for article 107c development and interface with the ARG was shown. The ARHWG last met on March 4. They plan to meet again after the TRIG meeting on May 6 at the PSE office in Burlington. Several draft annual reports (Articles 108 Gravel and 109 Large Woody Debris) were emailed March 31 to the ARG representatives for 30- day review. The next ARG meeting is scheduled as an in-person meeting file:///C|/...p/A9R2898.tmp/April%20Resource%20Group%20Update%20to%20the%20Baker%20River%20Coordinating%20Committee.htm[1/6/2011 10:19:29 AM] at PSE's Snoqualmie Operations Center on May 11, 2010 at 9:00 a.m. The agenda will include updates from the FPTWG meeting, ARHWG meeting and status of modeling development for 107c. The ARG and BRCC will join for a meeting on June 8th at the Baker Lake Lodge, followed afterward by a tour of the following fish facilities: UB FSC, hatchery and LB adult trap. ARG conference calls and in-person meetings are planned to alternate each month for the remainder of 2010. Recreation Resource Group RRG met on April 20 Law Enforcement Planning team met April 20, following RRG Aesthetics Management Plan out for formal review-Comments to back by April 30 Law Enforcement Management Plan out for formal review-Comments to be back by May 10 Next RRG meeting scheduled for June 15 at Skagit Service Center, Burlington The opening fishing season began on Saturday, April 24 Contracted Jamie VanDeVanter to design screening plan for UB Aesthetics plan. Once design is approved with RRG Pam will work with Scott Heller to develop design for LB Visitor Center aesthetics plan once Adult Fish Trap work is completed Cultural Resource Advisory Group The CRAG met on April 6, 2010 to discuss HPMP revisions. This was the final editing meeting and a proposed final HPMP for submission to FERC will be out for a 30-day review by July 1, 2010. Until that time, the CRAG will continue to provide comments and edits via email and phone. The next CRAG meeting is May 19, 2010 and the HPMP schedule as well as ongoing projects will be discussed. Terrestrial Resource Implementation Group The TRIG met on April 1st for a "face to face" meeting, which we plan to have around every third month (the rest will be WebEx and conference call). The meeting began with a presentation by Christina VerHeul of budget information related to funded license articles, and she noted that specific information on budgets is presented in the draft annual reports that were just sent to the TRIG. The TRIG went over a draft management program for the Alder Creek property, as well as a base map of the property. Field trips to the site to map wetlands and other habitat types for cover type mapping (which took place in mid-April) will gather data to be used in making specific cover type maps. Alternative properties were discussed, with "Property T" being put on hold for now, and "Property B" presented to the group with not much interest shown by the TRIG in pursuing it. Other properties will be looked at by Ira, Ray and Tony later in April, and an updated list of all the available properties prepared. This list and a property search process proposal will be presented during the May conference call. Loon surveys began in April, and they were combined with looking at more osprey nest trees for eventual treatment, and osprey use of nest platforms. The botanical field trip in wetlands at Baker Lake resulted in the development of preliminary planning for reed canarygrass management actions. Planning for 2010 weed management is ongoing, and ivy removal at the upper Baker Lake spawning beaches is being planned. The next scheduled TRIG meeting will be a short one- hour conference call and WebEx update on TRIG activities on May 6th, followed by the ARHWG meeting Cary Feldmann Manager, Resource Sciences Puget Sound Energy PO Box 97034 file:///C|/...p/A9R2898.tmp/April%20Resource%20Group%20Update%20to%20the%20Baker%20River%20Coordinating%20Committee.htm[1/6/2011 10:19:29 AM] Bellevue, WA 98009 Ph. 425-462-3088 Fax 425- 462-3223 cell 206-949-0415 cary.feldmann@pse.com file:///C|/...p/A9R2898.tmp/April%20Resource%20Group%20Update%20to%20the%20Baker%20River%20Coordinating%20Committee.htm[1/6/2011 10:19:29 AM]
