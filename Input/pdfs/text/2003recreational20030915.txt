Notes from RESOLVE Meetings To permit the greatest degree of open dialogue, the group agreed that notes for the RESOLVE sessions will be less formal than regular working group meetings. We will primarily document agreements and action items. RESOLVE Groundrules <b7> Work at understanding one another. <b7> Use airtime wisely. <b7> Speak honestly and respectfully. <b7> Examine assumptions. <b7> Make tentative agreements, then look at the whole package together. <b7> One meeting review rule: we have one meeting to review and change the tentative agreements of the previous RESOLVE session.1 <b7> Document our agreements. <b7> Caucuses are okay. Discussion of Action Items 1 All agreements are tentative even after the "one meeting review rule". However, the one meeting rule gives regular participants an opportunity to bring an agreement back to the table while assuring that tentative agreements are not forever reopened. It also accommodates regular participants who must miss a meeting and may want to weigh in on a decision. Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Recreation Resources Working Group Page 2 of 6   <b7> Some action items are long term or ongoing (for example, contacting WTA/VOW to help with trails). We should first find out how we can leverage/match funds with these groups. <b7> IAC workshop may be important in near term as it will help us write the PME in a grant-friendly way. <b7> Ann provided information on USFS visitor interpretive site layouts as they may apply to our visitor information portal. She also provided a Campground Interpretive Plan (guidelines). Education Meeting Report <b7> A large group met on September 10th to discuss the PSE education pilot and current NCI programs. Andy gave a report to this group on what was discussed. <b7> NCI has an interest in maintaining its funding; that other new programs don't come in and usurp its audience; and that young people have the opportunity to visit the North Cascade Environmental Learning Center (ELC). The NPS shares this last interest. <b7> PSE's interests include being able to tell its story to the 11 Counties it serves (WUTC requires PSE to inform all customers of these educational programs). <b7> NCI has concerns about long-term growth if PSE has a program also. <b7> PSE has concerns that NCI program can be seen as a "City Light Program". <b7> NCI is working on a proposal regarding how the two programs might work together. <b7> The next step is to bring NCI's response to this group. <b7> We should think about visiting the ELC together to understand what they're doing there. <b7> Andy will send out the NCI response when he receives it. Fourth Draft PME Review Notes: 1. We reviewed the 4th Draft PME's dated August 11, 2003 in this meeting. 2. Each Recreation PME will be outlined in the Recreation Management Plan. The actions that are present in the PMEs will provide direction in drafting the Management Plan and will be used for scoping purposes. 2.1.1: Water Safety: Additional Agreements2 <b7> Page 2: Description of Actions--Displays will be constructed according to USFS standards. We discussed how to get our arms around the scope/costs. For scoping purposes, we decided the displays would be similar to a standard double-panel signboard. This signage is part of a larger 2 Some PME's have been reviewed in previous meetings and the group has reached tentative agreements regarding them. When this occurs, these notes will reflect "Additional Agreements", i.e., agreements the group made at the meeting which are in addition to tentative agreements made in previous meetings regarding the same PME. Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Recreation Resources Working Group Page 3 of 6   signage plan which is driven by the interpretative plan which is part of the Recreation Plan. <b7> What needs to go on the sign includes: map, rules. <b7> Displays need to be commensurate with the sites mentioned (some will be larger, some smaller). <b7> We'll identify sites that are appropriate now. Providing hardening at future sites will come out of adaptive management (RAM Fund). <b7> Regarding tear sheets (page 3), keep these in staffed places, like boat ramps. Put laminated maps at dispersed sites. <b7> Copies of maps will be at key developed sites. <b7> The recreation maps would include recommended safe boating zones and boating safety rules. We don't want to make a lot of different maps. <b7> We might not actually use "tear sheet" maps and the maps may be larger than 8 <bd> X 11, especially if we use only one recreational map versus individual maps. <b7> Re Funding, don't specify who will do the work--we don't know that yet. <b7> Re floating log booms, future sites should be added to RAM.  2.1.3 Law Enforcement: Additional Agreements <b7> Summary of Action: Call out the tribes, if they have requisite authority. <b7> Re timing of Phase 1, it should end at the end of September. <b7> Re "Limit Access", specify drawdown zone or other restricted areas.  2.2.1 Dispersed Campsite Improvement: Agreements  <b7> Re O & M, Phase 1--clean up will be in accordance with "meaningful measures" (which Ann will give Andy).  <b7> Regarding sites without toilet facilities, give information regarding where to dump wastes and regarding self-contained units.  <b7> Regarding Appendix B:  o Change toilet brand names to descriptors (e.g., Romtec = vault toilet, Wallowa = box toilet);  o Add Bear Box to each hardened site;  o Iron Rangers will go into Phase 2 ("fee tubes");  o Increase the number of tent pads:   Baker River  8   Lake Side  6  Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Recreation Resources Working Group Page 4 of 6   Anderson Point  5   Depression  4 (lowered)  <b7> Phase 2 O & M is subject to adaptive management funding.  <b7> Recreation subgroup of the BRCC, in consultation with other subgroups, will determine if Phase 2 O & M is needed.  <b7> Throughout Phase 2 section, change "would" to "may" since not all actions will necessarily be required in Phase 2.  <b7> The monitoring program should include Lake Shannon.  2.2.2: Manage Dispersed Camping Impact: Agreements <b7> Regarding Scope examples: o There are levels of management of dispersed sites:  Encourage--we do things to attract visitors to the site;  Allow--we don't do things to attract visitors but we allow them there;  Discourage--we make the site less appealing or to discourage certain actions on the site;  Prohibit--we keep people out. <b7> At the beginning of the PME, specify that this PME goes hand in hand with 2.2.1 and these two PME's cover the dispersed management spectrum.  2.4.1: Create New Trails: Additional Agreements <b7> Under Summary, clarify that trails will be non-motorized. <b7> Regarding Description of Actions, under "Monitoring", add that conservation easements, land purchases could be used for new trails, if environmentally feasible.  2.4.2: Maintain Trails: Additional Agreements <b7> Under Scope Examples: add Rainbow Ridge trail. <b7> Under Funding, we need to further research user fee credits.  2.5.1: Enhance Bayview Campground <b7> Under Timing, implementation will begin (rather than "occur") within a year after the developed campground capacity exceeds 60% in July and August for 2 consecutive years, and will be completed within three years. Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Recreation Resources Working Group Page 5 of 6   <b7> Under Funding, say PSE will fund X% based on USFS capital improvement plan. <b7> Under Monitoring and Triggers, take out Boulder, Park and list Baker Lake without adding "As reconfigured". Do this to assure that the 60% trigger is based on like areas. The next Recreation RESOLVE will be held on October 3, 2003, from 9:00 a.m. <ad> 3:00 p.m. at USFS Office in Mountlake Terrace. Agenda for October 3, 2003 Meeting Review agenda, 9/15 notes and action items Discuss funding percentages based on Ed's and Jon's discussion Continue walk through of PME's Update on Education PME The group scheduled one additional RESOLVE session on October 24, 2003, in USFS Office in Sedro Wooley.
