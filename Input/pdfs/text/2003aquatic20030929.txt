Sue--re-write the Summary of Actions in 3.4.1 (Fluvial Geomorphic Management--page 61) to reflect the actions set forth in the PME. Notes from RESOLVE Meetings To permit the greatest degree of open dialogue, the group agreed that notes for the RESOLVE sessions will be less formal than regular working group meetings. We will primarily document agreements and action items. RESOLVE Groundrules <b7> Work at understanding one another. <b7> Use airtime wisely. <b7> Speak honestly and respectfully. <b7> Examine assumptions. <b7> Make tentative agreements, then look at the whole package together. <b7> One meeting review rule: we have one meeting to review and change the tentative agreements of the previous RESOLVE session.1 <b7> Document our agreements. <b7> Caucuses are okay. 1 All agreements are tentative even after the "one meeting review rule". However, the one meeting rule gives regular participants an opportunity to bring an agreement back to the table while assuring that tentative agreements are not forever reopened. It also accommodates regular participants who must miss a meeting and may want to weigh in on a decision. Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Aquatics Resources Working Group Page 2 of 4   Review of PME's Discussed To Date Note: In this meeting, we were working from 4rd draft PME's dated September 29, 2003. 3.2.1: Propagation <b7> Changes from the last meeting were all approved <b7> The last paragraph in the PME should be moved to 3.1--Aquatic Species Management Plan <b7> 20,000 pound capacity is okay <b7> The last two bullets under Propagation may need expansion. <b7> Move references to specific pounds/species to the appendix. <b7> Keep Steve's White Paper in mind for management plans (but do not include it in the PME). 3.4.1: Fluvial Geomorphic Management <b7> We need to wait for Sue's language on triggers and for refined results of study A16 3.1.1: HERC Fund <b7> Okay with current language <b7> Add a general definition section to the PME's. In it, define "Middle Skagit" and "Lower Skagit". <b7> Add a # 4 priority for HERC Fund use: "Elsewhere in the Skagit River Basin". 3.2.3: Downstream Passage Issues and Agreements <b7> Technical working group is pursuing the design--we don't need to work on that here. <b7> Regarding Modifications, following is the funding intent: o PSE will modify to meet performance standards. o We will have a separate account for modifications. It will be used to meet performance standards but can be used for other improvements to downstream passage. <b7> What's PSE's investment to meet standards before this fund kicks in? o We could trigger fund two years after acceptance of the final operating piece of this PME. <b7> How do we measure performance standards (e.g., where do we start to count?) so that we know when we've arrived? What's the process/schedule to meet standards if we miss at first? <b7> What happens if performance standards are not met by X year? <b7> What's proper level of iterative development if you can't completely meet performance standards? (What happens if you get to 90% of performance standards?) <b7> Gary suggested some changes for accuracy/clarity under "Description of Actions". <b7> What about other agencies operating the facility? o PSE needs to consider operational liability concerns before considering this further. Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Aquatics Resources Working Group Page 3 of 4   <b7> What is WDOE's 401 authority vis a vis downstream passage? Does it trump Section 18? 3.5: Water Quality Issues and Agreements <b7> Note: 3.4.3 (Erosion Management) a and b should be placed in Section 3.5.3 (Storm Water Pollution Prevention Planning). <b7> Add language about study for turbidity levels at Lake Shannon. <b7> Add language re extreme situations (to allow greater drawdown), "best public interest" standard. <b7> See action items: Bob Wright will do re-writes. 3.4.4: Habitat Restoration Issues and Agreements <b7> This PME: o It seems to assign PSE responsibilities for pre-project; o It seems to assign jurisdiction that could be argued; o It just includes the USFS; o There's a lack of certainty about money; o It does not appear to take into account actions taken under other PME's. <b7> We need further discussions to address these issues Agenda for 10/16/03 <b7> 3.4.1: Fluvial Geomorphic Management <b7> 3.3.1: Implement Flow Regime for Baker River Project (In Stream Flows) <b7> Reservoir Management Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Aquatics Resources Working Group Page 4 of 4    2003aquatic20030929.pdf en
