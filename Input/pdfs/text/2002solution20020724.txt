FUTURE MEETING DATES August 28, September 25, October 30, 2002 Because of Thanksgiving, consider either November 20th or December 4th for November Meeting. PROCESS FOR EDITING MINUTES We reviewed the language in the Communications Protocol for participant(s) to submit comments on draft minutes. It was observed that, in general, this process seems to be working well. In the future, we will italicize changes to draft minutes for ease in tracking changes. Substantive changes will be attached BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 7/24/2002 MEETING NOTES Page 1 Baker Solution Team- FERC PROJECT NO. 2150 to the “final” minutes. Editorial comments/later thoughts will be appended to the final minutes. Lyn at the meeting will bolster her efforts to check with members and gain consensus on how the notes should read, especially after a heated discussion.

Evaluate meeting BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 7/24/2002 MEETING NOTES Page 2 Baker Solution Team- FERC PROJECT NO. 2150 SETTLEMENT PROCESS UPDATE Dee reviewed with us how the Working Groups responded to our request to work toward creating an initial draft of potential PME options. In the three Working Groups, members expressed concern about the lack of sufficient time available to come up with this list, and all agreed to move forward under Dee’s guidance. She distributed an outline showing how she presented the process to come up with: • areas we know we want to address, • areas where we have insufficient information to even guess at a PME, and • areas where there is diversity (re: how we might address a particular issue). We noted this would by no means be an exhaustive or prioritized list. Dee also passed out an initial draft of a matrix the resource area teamlets will use to begin drafting PME options. She will integrate the following changes to the matrix: • Indication of related studies (ongoing/needed) • Timelines for those studies (to identify critical uncertainties for the Solution Team to address). Dee recommended that the Working Groups have their list of options for PMEs for Solution Team review at the October 30 Solution Team Meeting. Each Working Group needs the month of October to complete the task. Another issue raised by the Working Groups is how potential options for PMEs would be shared across the various resource areas Working Groups. Dee and Lyn will assure the work products from each Working Group are shared with the others. We reviewed and revised the draft criteria for narrowing options for PMEs. They are: REQUIRED: • Is it legal? • Addresses a Project impact. CONSIDERATIONS: • What interests are: 1) Met by PME 2) Not Met/In Conflict with PME • What might be unintended consequences? A. Within Resource Area B. With Other Resource Areas FERC CONFERENCE CALL • ALP – FERC’s July 19th Approval of Baker Project Request to use ALP. Struck Section VII of Communications Protocol’s/Process Document. FERC explained that the intent of striking Section VII of the Process Document was to remove only that language that related to the deferral of studies. In actuality, the entire section was removed. Many expressed a desire to withdraw their support for going forward with the ALP if the entire section was removed. After discussion, it was clarified that FERC’s desire to minimize things that might lead to delays was the driver here. Everyone except PSE said they would continue their support for the ALP without the study deferral-related language. Lloyd said he would have to review this “back at the ranch.” This Section VII was designed to reach agreement on PME in lieu of study; the BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 7/24/2002 MEETING NOTES Page 3 Baker Solution Team- FERC PROJECT NO. 2150 section covered the event final settlement was not reached. FERC has a process for handling additional studies (beyond the application deadline) if good cause can be shown. Steve and Keith agreed to send out a letter of clarification stating that only the study-deferral piece of Section VII be removed from the Process Document. This will save us from having to file a request for clarification with the Commission. In the initial paragraph under Section VII: we removed “and propose for Commission approval.” Previously, FERC would approve study schedules and deadlines. Steve will reflect this change in his letter. • Scoping Document 1 Comments Closing date was July 22. Received comments from NPS, Town of Concrete, Skagit County, WDFW, WDNR, and others. Steve will address comments received on Scoping Document 1 in a draft of Scoping Document 2 for the Solution Team to review. • Scoping Document 2 We raised the question as to whether we need to hold a public hearing and have a 60-day comment period as is cited in Section VI A of the Process Document. FERC doesn’t require either. We agreed not to hold the public meeting as listed in the last paragraph of that section. Steve will reiterate in his letter that FERC doesn’t require the meeting. • List of 3rd Party Consultants for Environmental Assessment Can we add to this list? What is the time frame? Steve reported that FERC reviews this list periodically. He wasn’t sure how someone might be added to the list. We routed a copy of the FERC-website guidelines for getting on the approved list. • Resource Agency Comprehensive Plans Steve encouraged agencies with comprehensive plans pertinent to the Baker Project to submit an original and eight copies to FERC for inclusion on their master list. FERC recognizes plans on the master list. PROCESS FOR ELEVATING ISSUES TO THE SOLUTION TEAM We reviewed and revised the draft outline of what the white papers would include: • Subject • Tie to relicensing • Summary of viewpoint • Who is for/against/neutral • How viewpoint meets the interests of team members • Required time frame for resolution by the Solution Team Other changes: • We replaced the word “position” with “viewpoint.” • We removed the word “opposing” from the first sentence after the asterisk. • We clarified the no more than 2-page rule with “not exceeding 4 double spaced pages”. BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 7/24/2002 MEETING NOTES Page 4 Baker Solution Team- FERC PROJECT NO. 2150 • We removed “two” since there may be more than two viewpoints that the Working Group is unable to resolve. Lyn will send the revised elevation process to Lloyd to distribute. REIMBURSEMENT POLICY Lloyd distributed PSE’s travel reimbursement form with the policy on the back. Participants (other than Federal and State agencies with conditioning authorities) may begin submitting for reimbursement of travel from January 1, 2002. ICD COMMENTS Lloyd distributed comments received by PSE on the ICD for our review. [To date: NPS, Skagit County, Federation of Fly Fishers, and Bill McMillan, personal comments.] PDEA CONTRACTOR Lloyd distributed FERC’s approved EIS contractor list for our review. All were encouraged to give Lloyd feedback by August 7th. PSE is conducting an informal background check on these contractors. PSE will ask a short-list of contractors for a Statement of Qualifications vs. RFP. A key criterion includes those who are familiar with NW ecosystems. We are also looking for contractors with a local presence. The week of August 4, PSE will solicit input /SOQ from contractors acceptable to the Solution Team. Contractors will be asked to respond with the list of actual folks who will be doing the work, a copy of previous work, experience in the Northwest, documentation of recent experience in EA/ EIS preparation, and a list of client references. The following is a list of Contractors known to be local: • EDAW, Inc. • Parametrix, Inc. • Normandeau Associates, Inc. • Dames and Moore --- URS • Louis Berger and Associates, Inc. • Environmental Resources Management (ERM) • Harza Engineering Co. • Jones and Stokes Associates, Inc. • HDR Engineering, Inc. • CH2M Hill Inc. • Acres International Corp. HYDROPS MODEL Joel discussed: • Technical review PSE is seeking an independent third party to verify and validate HYDROPS water flow, energy validation, etc. They are considering using Stetson Engineering to perform that function. Stetson is under contract to the USFS. PSE is having Mark Kilgore of Louis Berger conduct a confidence review of the model. It was suggested that the Corps participate in this review. Their flood reservoir-rule BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 7/24/2002 MEETING NOTES Page 5 Baker Solution Team- FERC PROJECT NO. 2150 curve will drive how PSE can operate during flood season. PSE has invited and will continue to invite the Corps to participate in this process. • Accessibility PSE is researching the ability to give folks remote access to the model. They are reviewing four proposals, including PC-Anywhere. They will let us know when an approach has been selected. Some “playful” runs may evolve into formal run requests (i.e., scenarios). • Request Form Joel distributed a completed draft of a study request form with a recreation request example. Working Groups would use the form to request scenarios to be formally run. As we begin using the model, we will revise these forms to better meet our needs. • Summary Reports Joel presented a draft summary scenario report [parameters included: releases, stages, reservoir elevations, spills, cavitation hours.] As we begin using the model, we will revise these summary reports to better meet our needs. Comments should go to Joel. RELICENSING SCHEDULE AND STUDIES REPORTING Lloyd distributed the latest study tracking reports [requests and ongoing studies] for our review. REPORT ON OLD ACTION ITEMS ; Connie: Attached letters of support for PSE’s request to use the ALP to meeting minutes. ; Connie: Drafted a letter summarizing schedule and sent to all resource members’ agency heads and asked how they want to participate in the process and how we can help. ; Lyn: Called missing Solution Team members and told them about the settlement process. ; Lloyd: Got Bob the Project number of the North Umpqua Settlement Agreement. P-1927  Steve H: Make sure those who sent letters of support for ALP process are added to FERC mailing list.  ALL: Gave Lloyd feedback on HYDROPS model study request form ASAP. ; Lloyd: Put together a Technical Working Group to resolve Model issues (access to and comfort with). ; Lloyd: Distributed a filled-out example of the HYDROPS model study-request form by July 11 for members to review. ; Lloyd: Touched base with Team Leaders re: issues that need to be resolved and sent out an update: 9 Studies being kicked back and forth between working groups: 1. Recreation and Aquatics on dispersed campsites and water quality (needs request rewrite). 2. Recreation and Terrestrial on project impacts on goats (controversial; possible elevation to Solution Team or a PME). 3. Aquatics and Recreation on trout in Baker Lake (group expressed this is not an issue). We agreed that it is up to the initiator (e.g., agency proposing the study request) to champion the request effort and if necessary across working groups and/or elevating it to the Solution Team. 9 Baseline vs. continuing impacts: According to FERC, “baseline” is April 30, 2006. We have agreed to this and to consider reference studies requests. BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 7/24/2002 MEETING NOTES Page 6 Baker Solution Team- FERC PROJECT NO. 2150 9 Recreation Working Group “consultant has not completed analysis of last field season data and is now planning the next field season without knowing gaps from first study.” First stage summary of 2001 data was distributed in February. A teamlet in March 2002 evaluated 2001 results and concluded coverage was sufficient for intended purposes and did not request 2002 or 2003 surveys. At the July meeting, most of second stage results were reviewed and contemplate second stage summary in August. ; Bill: Emailed Arn paper on Pacific Decadal Oscillation.  Rod: Send Lloyd email address for Lara Whitely Binder (UW). ; Lloyd: Considered glacier melting and Pacific Decadal Oscillation effects on hydrology model. ; Lloyd: Sent Bruce Freet detailed schedules for each resource group. ; Lyn and Stan: Revisited “Elevating Issues to Solution Team” protocol and spelled out content for white papers. WHAT’S HOT IN THE WORKING GROUPS Recreation: • Lots of information to digest • Anxiety re: aggressive schedule • Expectation that we can make decisions without all information Terrestrial: • Cross communication among working groups through website—put study plans, reports on website? • Fear that Solution Team members think we’re “slacking”—we’re not; we’re working hard together, just have tough issues Aquatics: • Settlement Issues • Limnology Study 2003 BUDGET PSE is entering their budget cycle for 2003. All should be considering 2003 study/ information needs and discuss with Team Leaders ASAP. PARKING LOT • Members need to describe their roles in terms of decision-making authority in their organizations (this relates to who would be members of the Policy Solution Team). • Define a process for delayed resolution (based on incomplete studies). • Adaptive management: • How can we take into account future technology, knowledge, conditions, resources, weather (global warming), etc.? • How can we balance licensee exposure? • How to enlist recreational users. • Define “project induced.” (Teamlet?) • FERC boundary. • Develop public information protocol.
