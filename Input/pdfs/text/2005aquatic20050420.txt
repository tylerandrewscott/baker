Next steps (proposed 2005 activities): • Bull trout distribution and abundance will be assessed through snorkel surveys of Upper Baker River’s lower 3 sections. PSE and R2 staff have been collecting genetic and scale samples and will submit them to the state lab when it is up and running later this year. • Lake Shannon / Baker Lake connectivity (proposed license article 104): Will continue snorkel surveys August through December to see if there’s a bi-modal influx of fish. Will include angling and Floy-tagging of char in Sulphur Creek and below Upper Baker Dam to check movements. They are also considering electro-fishing juveniles in Lake Shannon spring-fed tributaries to see if reproduction is occurring in tributaries other than Sulphur Creek. • PSE will be meeting with USFWS staff in early May to review proposed 2005 activities; they will report on final 2005 activities at the next ARG meeting. A-15: Upper Baker Delta Scour & A16: Lower Baker Alluvial Fan Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Aquatic Resources Working Group, April 20, 2005 Page 2 of 7 Phil handed out hard copies of A-15 and A-16 final draft reports and noted they are also available in CD / electronic format for those who want it. These reports are also available on PSE’s Baker Website. A-15 and A-16 results were presented last fall; these are the written summary reports. The conclusions are unchanged from previous presentations; these final reports provide more detail and background. A-09c: Middle Skagit Spawning Survey Phil handed out a written summary of the 2004 Skagit River spawning surveys. The results were described last fall in a PowerPoint presentation but a written report was prepared for the record. Skagit salmon spawning surveys will continue in the fall of 2005. An electronic version of the report is available on the PSE website. Phil and Stuart Beck-R2 are continuing work on the A-09 instream flow summary report; the report is quite extensive and will take several months to complete. Baker Project Updates on Fish Operations Doug reported that the gulper, net and transition structure are ready and waiting for fish. They are ready to collect DNA samples of the native char that arrive. Fry migration from Spawning Beach #4 continues. Over a million fry have outmigrated at Beach #4. None of the fish tested positive for IHN. The migration so far this year has been at a constant and steady pace. Doug reported that they have been pumping water into Beach #3 to maintain adequate water flow. Recent rain helped but wasn’t enough to warrant turning pumps off completely. Doug anticipates one more month of pumping on an as-needed basis until the fish all emigrate. 401 / CZMA Bob Barnes reported that the Water Quality Certification and JARPA were submitted to DOE March 8. Bob reported that there are two major unfinished tasks: Preparation of the “Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan” and the “In-Water Work Protection Plan.” The target date for submission of these plans in draft form is the end of June. Bob reported that they have been working closely with Ecology throughout this process and they are expecting things to go smoothly. The Coastal Zone Management Application has also been submitted to WDOE. PSE is completing a short form that they just received from WDOE and will get that turned in by April 21. Study A-05: Water Quality Since that study was done, additional work on Total Dissolved Gas (TDG) was done at Upper Baker. These levels are much less than at Lower Baker. The exception is spill events; during these events, TDG is about 110% as it exits the Upper Baker and about 107% as it passes through Lower Baker. Bob reported he has also been working on new ways to integrate existing data, including temperature baselines for monitoring purposes. The aim is to try to format and analyze the data in ways that better accommodate DOE’s process. The potential impact of the floating surface collector is adding Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Aquatic Resources Working Group, April 20, 2005 Page 3 of 7 complexity to this process from a regulatory standpoint. The FSC limits the use of existing conditions as baseline. Ecology is currently re-evaluating some of its hydro-electric plant related policies and regulations accordingly. Bob will keep us posted. Snow-Pack Update: We have had recent precipitation at the Upper Baker. The conditions are better now than they were 6 weeks ago but are still the worst on record (estimated at roughly 30% of normal). Bob stated that we will have better information in 24 hours. Chuck reported that the Lake Washington Basin is a similar story: they were at 1% of average, and are now at 16% of average. FORMATION OF BRICC Cary reported that the BRCC is meeting in an interim fashion pending license approval. BRICC is moving along because there are projects that must be started in advance of license issuance in order to meet the schedule. PSE’s team is working on implementation scheduling to support early- implementation efforts and ensure later projects are scheduled for on-time completion. As the ARG continues to meet, we will do so in a manner that is consistent with how we would operate if the license had already been issued. There will be a formal designation of ARG reps once the license is issued. We want to do what we can in the meantime to update our distribution lists accordingly. Connie Freeland is getting input from various entities re: primary and back-up reps. GROUP NORMS We reviewed draft BRCC operating norms. We will use these as a basis for our norms for this working group. Specifics called out in the license will, of course, be followed. We have the option to adopt other social norms as appropriate. We agreed that having an agenda is critical to meeting productivity and should be included in our norms. The group should review both sets of norms; send BRICC norms suggestions to Cary, and ARG norms suggestions to Arnie. EARLY IMPLEMENTATION Montgomery-Watson-Harza will continue to support the design development for the Downstream Fish Passage facilities discussed in the proposed License Article 105 (now at the 30% design submittal). HDR/FishPro was selected for developing the facilities design for the Hatchery Facilities discussed in the proposed License Article 101. They are close to being under contract, so this work has not begun yet. The Washington Group was selected to develop the Powerhouse upgrade design called out in proposed License Article 106. R2 Resource Consultants, under subcontract to Washington Group was selected as a sub-contractor for the Upstream Fish Passage design and the prime contractor for the Passage Connectivity in proposed in License Article 104. The various management plans called out in proposed License Articles 106, 108, 109 and 110 will be supported also by R2. Development of those management plans (including: Flow Implementation, Gravel, LWD, and Shoreline Erosion) is scheduled to start in January 2006. FISH PASSAGE TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP REPORT Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Aquatic Resources Working Group, April 20, 2005 Page 4 of 7 The Fish Passage Technical Working Group will continue to meet as a separate function of the Aquatic Resources Group going forward in 2005. Nick shared a detailed design and construction schedule of implementation of fish passage activities (both upper and lower Baker for upstream and downstream passage). The schedule includes downstream facilities at both Upper (Mar. 2008) and Lower (Mar. 2011) Baker. The most important construction activity is the Graving Dock (launch site) in October of this year. Their last meeting was January 11 and their next meeting is May 3. At that meeting, they’ll be discussing the biological assessment for the FSC, as well as finishing the physical and mathematical modeling. Let Nick know if you are interested in joining that meeting. We can expect to get continued updates from them on three major components: FSC, GuideNet, and NTS. INITIAL WALK-THROUGH OF NORMS We walked through the draft BRICC Norms, with an eye toward what would be appropriate for this aquatics group going forward. Cary and Arnie took notes for incorporation into the next draft of meeting norms. Changes suggested to the draft BRICC norms handout in the order that they are listed are as follows: Official Meeting Procedures: 1. Change to “at least annually” 2. Change to “at least 10 days” … 14 days in the case of meetings which will include a vote / decision by the group New: Add item indicating decision-making model (consensus) for ARG 10. Parenthetical typo … this language needs clarification to indicate that “a quorum requires one representative from each of the following groups: federal (list), tribes (list), state (list), and licensee” … also add language to indicate that quorum is needed “for decisions” 11. Needs a period at the end … needs clarification Other Sections: • Meeting Conduct, move numbers 7 & 8 to Participant Responsibilities • Add ‘list of handouts’ and ‘decisions made’ to the meeting minutes section • “Team Leader” change to “Chair” • Chair will ensure that draft minutes are sent within 5 business days • Changes in minutes will be sent to ___ within 10 business days of receipt to incorporate • Members joining by phone will identify themselves upon login • Designated alternatives may represent the member in person or via phone • Let chair know if you’ll be absent or late • Chair provides notice of meeting locations, times, changes • Merge F & G • Norms should be reviewed / edited at least annually MEETING EVALUATION What Went Well • Facilitation to assist phone people in hearing soft-spoken folks • Thanks, Nick, for the salmon!
