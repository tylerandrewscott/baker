Send directions to Tony to include in minutes. <b7> Lauri: Draft study request for BBS. <b7> Tony: Follow up with Bob re: Park Landbird Inventory Monitoring Data. <b7> Tony: Update contact list and send it to team members (share with cultural/historical Working Group). <b7> Tony: Get statement of qualifications from proposed contractors and send to team members. <b7> Tony and Ann: Draft study request for RT-16. <b7> Tony, Don, Chris Lawson: Continue to discuss recreational study synergies in relation to R-T9 and 10. <b7> Jessie: Get input from Cultural/Historical Working Group re: vegetation mapping. <b7> Don: Send cover types list(s) to Tom and Shari. <b7> Tom: Summarize list(s) of cover types for basin wide mapping and project area mapping for our review. <b7> Tony: Add Shari Brewer to distribution list for this Working Group.  REPORT ON PAST ACTION ITEMS <b7> All: Sent Tony a list of documents that consultants can use to expedite their review of species (T-4) <b7> All: Reviewed draft study plans and requests prior to next meeting (see discussion below on reviewing documents). <b7> Tony: Brought those Mint Milanos! (really, the credit goes to Marty!) <b7> Lauri: Checked with Kelly McAllister to see if PSE could use State experts to assist with this study (R-T11) She said that there are no state sponsored surveys going on that would overlap with RT11, and no state biologists available to help in the study. <b7> Lauri: Forwarded information on the tailed frog to Tony, Don, and Bob K. <b7> Tony: Talked to Shari about vegetation types important to the Sauk-Suiattle. She will give a presentation on this topic today at our meeting. It is likely that separate studies will be done to meet tribal interests (by Cultural/Historical Working Group)  REPORT FROM RECREATION WORKING GROUP (RECREATION USE STUDY) Tony reported that the Recreation Working Group is doing recreation user surveys. Researchers are conducting recreation interviews at campsites, interviews at checkpoints, and are using drop box surveys. There are specific questions about trails that people are using. Don feels that this methodology is limited because it doesn't tell us what percentage of high elevation use is related to recreation at the reservoir. In  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 5/15/2001 MEETING NOTES L Wiltse for Terrestrial Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 2 of 6   the absence of this information, Don would like to see us move forward with the mountain goat study. There may be other species (i.e. grizzly bears, wolves, etc.) that we may also want to study. The Recreation Working Group has not yet agreed on a definition of "project-induced recreation". We need to continue to work with the Recreation Working Group to see that studies are done to meet our interests. SHARI BREWER'S PRESENTATION ON TERRESTRIAL ISSUES FROM SAUK-SUIATTLE PERSPECTIVE Shari (consultant to the Sauk-Suiattle Tribe): Shari reviewed the cultural and spiritual significance of the mountain goat to the Sauk-Suiattle Tribe. She distributed handouts on the importance of mountain goats to the Sauk-Suiattle Tribe and on goat monitoring efforts. Shari also distributed for viewing by the group her copies of information on other terrestrial resources important to the tribe. PSE will scan the presentation handouts and make them available on the web. Highlights of the presentation are as follows: <b7> The native mountain goat's struggle for survival is symbolic of the Tribe's own history. <b7> There were as many as 10,000 mountain goats in Washington State in historic times. This number has dwindled to around 100 in the Darrington area and 368 in the Mt. Baker area. <b7> The Sauk-Suiattle Indian Tribe had a population of 3500 before 1855. By 1920. The number fell to 17. Today the Tribe's enrollment is 200. <b7> Archeological evidence shows tribal use of the mountain goat dating back thousands of years. <b7> The Sauk-Suiattle Indian Tribe used the mountain goat in various ways: <b7> The wool was used in making blankets and clothing <b7> The horns and bones were used to form tools and other implements to sustain a tribal livelihood. <b7> It's pure white fat was used to make a beauty cream. <b7> The meat was eaten fresh or dried to provide one of the food sources during winter months. <b7> The mountain goat spirit was sought in a spiritual quest (like the eagle). The Sauk-Suiattle Indian Tribe promotes a position to preserve and protect herds of mountain goats in the North Cascades for all time. Shari mentioned culturally significant species, such as: red and yellow cedar, cranberry, cattails, cherry trees, Labrador tea, sundew, bog bean, yellow pad lily, wild crab apple, bear Grass (needs fire), wild strawberry, gooseberry, Oregon grape, and salmon berry. Tom Hamer suggested that we integrate a survey of culturally significant plants into our rare plant survey. Fred suggested that we do what we can to work with the Cultural/Historical Working Group to take into account culturally significant plants, and that the cover type mapping we do should be done on a deeper level into the classification in areas such as bogs in order to identify rare or culturally significant plants. The vegetation studies being proposed in RT2 study are not basin-wide but are limited to the project area. Shari suggested that we translate General Land Office (GLO) notes into a GIS layer to see what's there. Jessie (Team Leader of the Cultural/Historical Working Group) reported that that Working Group is discussing creating a GIS layer from the GLO notes and integrating that into archeological and traditional cultural studies. She suggested we wait and address this after formal consultation with the Tribes. With input from the Tribes, the Cultural/Historical Working Group could work with this Working Group to develop a study that would address culturally significant plants. Shari suggested we may want to bring in Jan Henderson to help.  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 5/15/2001 MEETING NOTES L Wiltse for Terrestrial Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 3 of 6   Shari suggests including rock out-crops in our cover-type mapping (looking for berries), also looking for cranberry marshes, cedar trees. Jessie will be the interface between this group and the Cultural/Historical Working Group re: input for basin level mapping.  Studies Note: be sure all Study Plans are dated and that they have been reviewed by the author/submitter before being shared with the Working Group members.  STATUS OF: R-T2 Vegetation Mapping In Project Area Preliminary Study Plan being prepared by Hamer Environmental, by end of the week. Will meet with authors before sending out for comment.

DISCUSSION OF STUDY REQUESTS R-T9: Recreation Use Study Put on hold: Don will come up with some conceptual approaches to enhancements to goat population - July timeframe R-T10: Recreational Effects on Mountain Goat Habitat Use Put on hold. R-T11: Oregon Spotted Frog Inventory Preliminary Study Plan being prepared by Hamer Environmental R-T12: Grizzly Bear Spring Foraging Habitat Value Put on hold: refer issue of continuing impacts to Solution Team for resolution and see where Grizzly Bears fall in Species Assessment.
