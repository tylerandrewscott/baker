Final Minutes Baker Project Terrestrial Resources Working Group PME Meeting December 5, 2002 Attendees: Tony Fuchs, Laura Potash (by telephone for first <bd> hour), Marty Vaughn, Gene Stagner, Lauri Vigue, Bob Nelson, Patrick Goldsworthy, Cary Feldmann, Kathy Smayda, Dee Endelman (facilitator) The group began by discussing our role in PME development and what the PME's we developed would be used for. Our mutual understanding is that they will be used: 1. In the cross resource workshops, to discuss cross resource implications, commonalities and conflicts; 2. As potential information for the PDEA; and 3. As recommendations for the negotiations team. We discussed how, in areas where the group reaches consensus, these would be powerful recommendations to the Solution Team. Before we began our review, Marty asked Laura if she wanted him to update the two PME's for which she is lead (106 and 107)1 once her Teamlet had made its edits. Laura said she would document the edits to the PME's. Dee asked that one person be sent copies of any edited versions, a "keeper of the document versions". This will be Marty. We began with a review of PME 102 ("Manage lands outside the existing Project boundary to benefit wildlife") using the following questions as guides: 1. What questions do we have to clarify the PME? 2. What information can we add to the PME now? 3. What information do we still need to get? 4. How will we get it? 1 PME 106 is "Develop and implement a noxious week management plan". PME 107 is "Develop and implement a management plan for plants of special status".   Marty took notes of the changes the group suggested. He will prepare the next versions of the PME's we reviewed today. Teamlet Leads will take the additional information needs identified today and, where possible, research them or delegate them to another Teamlet member. After completing our review of PME 102, we reviewed 101, 111 and 103.2 We had also planned to review 105 ("Contribute funding to plant and wildlife research"). However, Bob Kuntz, who is on that Teamlet, was unable to attend the meeting and we decided his input on this item would be needed. Regarding 105, Tony and Bob will meet. The group asked them to consider possible making 105 an action item under 111. Following are the next steps designed to get the first draft PME's prepared: 1. Regarding the PME's reviewed today (101, 102, 103, 111), Marty will send the edited versions to the Teamlet leads (by when?) 2. Teamlet leads will contact Teamlet members about the identified information needs. 3. At the next Terrestrial Working Group meeting (December 19, 2002), we will review unmet Study needs and make sure people are assigned to gather other information needs. 4. Regarding all other PME's, Marty will send out an e-mail asking Working Group members to send comments to the Teamlet leads by December 13, 2002. The Teamlet leads will forward these comments to Marty by the morning of December 18, 2002. 5. At the meeting of December 19, 2002, Marty will distribute an updated set of PME's. 2 PME 101 is "Manage lands within the existing Project boundary to benefit wildlife"; 111 is "Create and fund a Terrestrial Resource Management Group to oversee implementation of terrestrial PME measures"; and 103 is "Provide technical and/or financial support to landowners interested in enhancing their lands for wildlife."    2002terrestrial20021205.pdf en
