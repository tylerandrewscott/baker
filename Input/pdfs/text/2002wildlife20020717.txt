JUNE WETLAND FIELD TRIP • Visited Wetland areas BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 7/17/2002 MEETING NOTES Kristen Schuldt for Terrestrial Technical Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 2 of 5   • • • • • • •  • • • •  Behind West Pass Dike where hydrology relates to reservoir One with own hydrology – good potential for enhancement Complex near mouth of Sandy Creek - lots of diversity in upper area (were looking at wetlands related to reservoir) Lauri suggested need some monitoring – mapping is done (T5) Group discussion for phase 2 - are there monitoring activities to do to determine project effects and monitoring to evaluate areas for enhancement? The group questioned the need for wetland monitoring. Marty suggested and group will consider this hypothesis – monitor if we anticipate significant change to reservoir regime that would affect wetlands. With current regime, it’s stable wetland situation, meaning that the wetlands currently exist the way they are due to current regime. What constitutes “ significant change”? What happens during growing season? Would it be worth looking at additional wetlands and at high water level of ones we looked at last month? Group agreed they should add an action item to plan looking at wetland maps in August and have another field trip then answer the question re: hydrological monitoring  SOULTION TEAM UPDATE/TIMELINE • Tony reported that • Public meetings “kicked off” timing for relicensing • Applied for ALP – expect approval (team leader note, FERC approved ALP request on 7/19/02) • Comment period for ICD is almost over • SD1 is also out for comments • Dee gave a presentation on the Solution Team’s settlement process. She presented a series of handouts outlining the concepts for the settlement process, and presented the following timeline: • 1st draft PME’s 10/02 • Solution team has draft PME’s ready 4/30/03 st 7/13/03 • 1 draft settlement agreement • 2nd draft settlement agreement 10/29/03 • Final agreement 3/2/04 • Submit final agreement 4/30/04 • Settlement process discussion: The group voiced concerns about studies still needing to be done, timing, integrating PME proposals, etc. Dee asked if this working group was willing to follow the Solution Team’s settlement process, and over the next three months, to spend time to identify PME options and prepare a draft by October. Some work would be done between meetings, but at working group meetings no more than 90 minutes per meeting will be spent on settlement. The working group took a vote on their willingness to enter into this process using the following measurements: Reaching Consensus (Between A & D = Consensus) A. I enthusiastically support the decision; I believe its our best effort B. I find the decision wholly acceptable BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 7/17/2002 MEETING NOTES Kristen Schuldt for Terrestrial Technical Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 3 of 5   C. I can live with the decision, but I’m not enthusiastic about it. D. I don’t really like the decision, but I won’t stand in the way of it’s adoption if the rest of the group supports it. I’d like my concerns know. However, once the decision is made I’ll support it. E. I don’t agree with the decision and I feel strong resistance for its adoption. F. I don’t believe the group has come together at all behind the decision. We need more discussion and work before any decisions adopted •  Settlement vote outcome and concerns: • Of the 9 people who voted, the total votes were: A = 3, C = 2, D = 4 • Are we putting the cart before the horse? • Are we taking away valuable time from study plan development? • Are we going to cut out important studies as a result of this process?

QA/QC to follow. • Hamer will focus on this (only 10% done currently). • Species list handed out along with Analysis Species Literature Search Procedure handout and group reviewed them. • Re: unknown species – not critical path item right now. • Ann conveyed Don’s concerns need deadlines, also “species to be determined list” – may be able to drop for some habitat types. Group agreed the teamlet could decide. • Lauri suggestion: Bat survey. • Literature summaries will be done this fall. • Lia will provide examples of some species review by the next meeting. Discrepancies in some of wetland identifications. Joetta is reconciling, it’s minor. Wetlands inventoried in the T5 study are mapped together with cover types from the T2 study. Not discussed at this meeting. Marty will add references for predictive model – Lauri will get a copy of BLM reference to Marty. GLO input done July 16th for Lake Shannon. Digitizing of delineated overlays from AESI for Baker Lake finished by July 31. Taking info from spreadsheets and plotting coordinates. Final report will be done by August 30th By September 7th final report will be done (assuming Joetta  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 7/17/2002 MEETING NOTES Kristen Schuldt for Terrestrial Technical Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 4 of 5   T15  Mollusk Survey Basin Vegetation Mapping  T16  Project Area Rare Plant Survey  T17  Amphib.

Mapping and Seral Stage draft maps are ready for review. • Started field work after special workshop (see update on handout). Tom reported that it looks like they’ll finish on time. • Groups response to Sarah’s questions (in handout): • Re: 51 sites in inundation zone – group suggested they be attempted in the fall after rest of survey (if there signs of vegetation Sarah should look) • Okay not to show survey route as long as survey boundaries are delineated on maps (assume complete survey w/in boundary) • Should she conduct rare plant survey on SE end of Baker Lake? – Sarah will coordinate with Ann and Ann will make the determination • Group concurred: Hamer to identify grasses only to level of genus unless easily to sp. • Ann noted that Hypogymnia need to be taken to species level – it’s on the USFS Survey and Manage species list. • Sarah needs list of all sites to be surveyed – her numbers aren’t matching up. • Tony explained that dispersed recreation sites were selected during a teamlet with Ann, Lauri and Erin. Wetland sites were ones where hydrology influenced by reservoir Taking UTM coordinates from spreadsheets and plotting coordinates.
