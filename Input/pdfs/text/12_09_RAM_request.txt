The first decision requested is :"shall the Recreation Resource Group (RRG) allocate the 2009 RAM funds, $50,000 (2006 dollars), to the USDA-FS for the Baker Lake Resort Redevelopment." The second decision requested is :"shall the Recreation Resource Group (RRG) allocate the 2010 RAM funds, $50,000 (2006 dollars), to the USDA-FS for the Baker Lake Resort Redevelopment." A decision to allocate both the 2009 and 2010 RAM funds at this time would provide a known level of funding for reconstruction coordination and 2010 construction contracts.
