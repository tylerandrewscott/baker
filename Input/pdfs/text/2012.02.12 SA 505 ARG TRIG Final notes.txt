Sue suggested that Jeremy provide a planning proposal to help strengthen the justification for such projects. Does the TRIG and ARG authorize funding of the Hansen Creek Project as proposed by the Skagit River System Cooperative for an amount not to exceed $390,000 with current funds from SA 505, with $110,000 for immediate use and the balance ($280,000) reserved for anticipated acquisitions? The funding decision was approved by consensus of those present in person. Lower Baker River Project Sue suggested to the group that they consider whether the Little Baker River project described to the group at the January 24 meeting would be considered “in Baker River basin” or “out of basin.” This project may be brought to the group for consideration for funding before the next funding cycle. NEXT STEPS: Jacob will contact the project proponents to let them know the decisions made today. He will move forward with contracting and scoping work in the next couple of weeks; he will work with the proponents on this.
