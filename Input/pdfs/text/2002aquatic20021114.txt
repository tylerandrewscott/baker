REVIEW RELICENSE SCHEDULE Arnie reported that the schedule is in the process of being revised, based on the ESA and Water Quality Certification meetings that flanked the Solution Team meeting last month. He will send it out for our review when it is complete.  SETTLEMENT PROCESS - PMEs Cary walked us through a re-grouping of potential PMEs that he and Arnie put together in response to concerns expressed by several members that our list was unwieldy and at too high a level to be as meaningful as it might be. Folks seemed to appreciate the reformatting attempt.  Next Steps: <b7> Arnie will send out a revised list after performing a careful review to see that all potential PMEs from the spreadsheet were included. This will mean fleshing out the detail considerably. Working Group members will review this new list to see that their interests are represented and send Arnie any additional feedback prior to the December meeting.  FISH PASSAGE TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP REPORT: The Group hopes to finalize a conceptual design for Upstream passage by year-end.  The next meeting will be December 10. They will meet on December 13 to discuss biological implications of Studies. It looks like Study results may not help narrow options.  Baker River Project Relicense Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 11-14-02_Final_fishWG_notes; Lyn Wiltse  2 of 11   The meeting in January will be to finalize an alternative development process for Downstream passage options.  REPORT FROM INSTREAM FLOWS TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP See A9 in matrix below.  STUDY REQUEST SUBMITTALS/STUDY PLAN DEVELOPMENT  Study #  Title  Notes/Next Steps  A01.A Reservoir Tributary Habitat Surveys A draft single report that incorporates the results of  A-01a, A-01b and A-26b will be completed by  year-end (2002). ACTIVE  A01.B Reservoir Tributary Biological Surveys A draft single report that incorporates the results of  A-01a, A-01b and A-26b will be completed by  year-end (2002). ACTIVE  A01.C Reservoir Tributary Delta Surveys  A draft single report that incorporates the results of  A-01a, A-01b and A-26b will be completed by  year-end (2002). ACTIVE  A02 LB River Habitat Mapping  Results of completed habitat mapping surveys will  be combined with biological surveys into a single  report. Nick reported that they did some  snorkeling, hook and line, and trapping October 16  and 17. They saw only one cutthroat, and some  sculpin. Visibility was adequate (3-5 ft.). This  verified the 1st survey they did where we saw very  few fish and no char.  A03 Reservoir Fish Population  Links to A19 and A26a.  Characteristics  A04 LB/Skagit River Flow, Gaging A05 Water Quality Sampling A06 UB Passage Design Baffle Modification A07 Lower Baker Forebay Bathymetry A08 UB Passage System Evaluation  Links to A9. ACTIVE The teamlet met November 8 to review the status of water quality sampling leading toward the 401 Water quality Certification. They are looking at total dissolved gas, temperature, turbidity, etc. They also agreed to expand the number of sample sites from 8 to 9. The challenge is getting sufficient background data to allow them to relate water quality conditions to the Project. Some operating scenarios may be contributing to the turbidity immediately below the dam. We will also be looking at reservoir levels and their contribution to water quality. Complete. Complete.

A13B Water Quality Impacts on Aquatic  R-2 recorded all substrate, bank and cover elevations in the last three weeks (late October to mid November `02). They are waiting to take high flow measurements. We are hoping this will happen in the near future. They would wait for a descending limb of a high water event. In order to gage fish behavior during pulsing, R-2 will be laying rebar to mark redd locations and then observe how fish behave relative to the varial zone created by the pulse (PSE released 2-3 hour pulses on daily basis as per the IPP). In December, Phil would like to analyze fish response to a longer pulse, such as six hours. R-2 will look to see if fish show any signs of site fidelity in the varial zone. They will continue to look at this when PSE resumes a regular operating schedule. They have been identifying distributions and collecting measurements the last few weeks (early November '02). Adam will present findings at our December meeting. <b7> 605 Chinook redd measurements were recorded <b7> 487 Chum redd measurements (measuring mass more than individuals) have been recorded to date. Phil proposes we switch back to plane surveys now. Since our clear weather and clear water conditions will be limited through the winter, our ability to get good measurements will also be limited.. Concern was expressed about making sure the survey includes the Hamilton-downstream stretch. Phil reported we already have that information for chinook and will try to also get that for chum. Not discussed at 11/14/02 meeting. We just got the NMFS collection permit (August 2002). ACTIVE Complete. Note: USFW is concerned with impacts to char and indirectly to bald eagles through chum and also to cutthroat. Tie to A26. Split between R-A21 & R-A09. Removed from list of studies this group will address, reported by Brady in September. Gretta reported the USFS will pursue this in the recreation working group.

Awaiting results of A14a. Not discussed at 11/14/02 meeting. Jenny (AESI ) reported that the aim of this study is to document existing erosion and deposition features along Baker and Shannon shorelines. They are also working on how to estimate annual bank retreat (acreage lost for high and severe areas). Hoping to complete this work by December. Members were asked to provide input to Jenny on the mapping (i.e., on Draft Report submitted 10/17/02 to the working group). ACTIVE Not discussed at 11/14/02 meeting. Currently doing field work to support this study. Put in eight transects and 5 scour monitors, and surveyed thalweg profiles in the Delta Left and Delta Right distributary channels. Lost all the scour monitors in the first week. Data gathered this year will be useful for isolating the effects in the drawdown zone since flows have remained steady this fall. Sue discussed the proposed approach with Devin Smith of the SSC. Sue and Devin will also be meeting with the ACOE (re: Little Baker project) next week to discuss linkages between the two studies and coordinating work efforts. Next step will be development of a study plan. Study request pending from USFS. This is related to A36. Brady is in the process of re-working it. Merged into A01a and A01b. ACTIVE. This study has been combined with A26. Mike Gagner (R2) presented an overview of objectives and individual tasks associated with this study along with some of the preliminary results that are already available for some of the tasks. The goal is to complete LWD models 1 and 2 and have draft report out for working group review prior to December meeting, 2002. The study is looking at input to the Baker Project Area using 3 methods: <b7> Air photo analysis (1940-1999 photographs) <b7> Regional data from comparable systems <b7> Develop LWD budget based on remote sensing and literature values This study will also describe the biological role of LWD in stream and reservoir systems. In evaluating historic changes in LWD input, 5 of 11   A21 Skagit Wild & Scenic River Values A22 Baker Lake Trout Impacts Evaluation A23 Baker River Wild & Scenic River Values A24 Hydrologic and Geomorphic Analysis Baker River Project Relicense Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 11-14-02_Final_fishWG_notes; Lyn Wiltse  storage and management, they found that in 1969 PSE hired a contractor to clear out all the LWD that had accumulated in Lake Shannon. This clearing was extremely thorough and reduced LWD levels down from 20K m3 to around 1K m3 in 1972. LWD budget concept: Mass balance of LWD is a consequence of input, output, storage, and depletion. Mike observed that LWD appears to currently be playing a relatively "small" role in the Baker reservoir systems as most of it has been cleared away and there appears to be a "limited" annual input. Most of the LWD is deposited at or above full pool elevation. Steve suggested Mike also look at the benefits and limitations of passing LWD downstream. Sue said we will be able to come up with a very rough estimate of what future LWD would come out of the Baker relative to the Skagit (based on some ratio basin size and stream network density). Arn suggested Mike touch base with Mike McHenry of the Lower K'lallum tribe re: some data he has re: LWD and the Elwa. ACTIVE This is being addressed by A9 and A24. No longer necessary due to change in management direction in favor of cancellation of non-native trout stocking in the reservoirs. Removed from list of studies we will consider. This is being addressed through A15. Sue gave a presentation on the status of this study so far. With regard to sediment transport, the questions are: <b7> What is the annual sediment yield to the Baker Basin? <b7> Where is sediment transported to Lake Shannon and Baker Lake deposited? <b7> What proportion of the Skagit sediment load would the Baker Basin contribute without the influence of the project? Sue reported that she came up with some estimate of total average sediment yield in terms of tons per square mile. She found that the glacial systems had higher sediment than non-glacial systems. She kept the elevated sediment input she found in Thunder Creek separate from the other glacial systems since 6 of 11   Baker River Project Relicense Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 11-14-02_Final_fishWG_notes; Lyn Wiltse  its sediment levels far exceeded the average and the other glacial sources were well within average ranges. She took the average values from the data she actually collected in the Basin and used that as a low-end sediment yield. She used numbers from the literature search as the high-end sediment yield. The total sediment delivered to Baker Lake from the tributaries was: <b7> Weighted ave. of 512 tons/square mile <b7> Suspended sediment of 445 tons/square mile (probably collecting on the old Baker River Channel) <b7> Bedload of 67 tons/square mile (settles out at the edge) <b7> Baker Lake trap efficiency is 90% (100% of bedload, 89% of suspended sediment) <b7> Total sediment delivered to Lake Shannon: 11% of suspended sediment The total sediment delivered to Lake Shannon from the tributaries was: <b7> Weighted ave. of 474 tons/square mile <b7> Suspended sediment of 412 tons/square mile (probably collecting on the old Baker River Channel) <b7> Bedload of 62 tons/square mile (settles out at the edge) <b7> 11% of Suspended load from Baker Lake Lake Shannon trap efficiency is 78% (100% of bedload, 75% of suspended sediment) Total sediment delivered to Skagit: suspended sediment equal to 25% Future Inputs Without Project Influence: The total sediment delivered to natural Baker Lake from mainstem and tributaries was: <b7> Weighted ave. of 582 tons/square mile <b7> Suspended sediment of 515 tons/square mile (probably collecting on the old Baker River Channel) <b7> Bedload of 77 tons/sq. mile (settles out at edge) Baker Lake trap efficiency is 75% (100% of bedload and 77% of suspended load) Total sediment outgoing to Upper Baker Dam 7 of 11   A25 Unnatural Predation A26A Reservoir Limnology-Production Potential A26B Tributary Production Potential A27 Middle Skagit Incubation Flows A28 Fish Passage-Reservoir Management A29 Estimate Sockeye Production from Different Incubation Sources R-A30 Near-Field Smolt Behavior Baker River Project Relicense Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 11-14-02_Final_fishWG_notes; Lyn Wiltse  subbasin: suspended sediment equal to 29% Total sediment delivered to Skagit River: 100% of sediment delivered by tribs downstream of natural Baker Lake and 29% of suspended from historic Baker Lake subbasin. Baker Contributions to Skagit River: Without Project: <b7> Total Baker drainage area = 297 square miles <b7> Effective Baker R. contributing area = 179 sq mi and proportion of total Skagit River basin at Mt. Vernon = 6%. Baker Contributions to Skagit River: Alternative analysis: <b7> Contributing area (w/o Baker or Upper Skagit) = 1,621 sq. mile <b7> Annual unit sediment yield = 494 tons/square mile <b7> Estimated inputs from Upper Skagit w/o project = 500 to 1,000 tons/square mile <b7> Modeled Baker inputs = 4 to 9% of total This wasn't discussed at the November 14 meeting. Work on this will start in mid January. The primary focus will be predation at collection and release points. Nick reported that they have narrowed the consultant selection down to three. The teamlet will meet after this meeting to make the final selection. They should be able to turn the data around by the end of February 2003. This will be in enough time for the next field season. Emily will complete the report by year-end (2002). This report will include findings for A01a and A01b. She may give us a presentation on findings at our December meeting. Addressed in A9.

The main focus of this study is to compile existing data and do some genetic sampling to determine the genetic makeup of Rainbow trout in Baker Lake. This study would address a conservation issue (protection/support of native species) as well as recreation. There is an opportunity to piggyback onto the genetic research being conducted by Seattle City Light for rainbow stocks elsewhere in the Skagit basin. Mark is the keeper of those samples and is willing to hold them until we have obtained our samples so they could be run together. Many expressed concern that we would be able to get the 100 samples requested to conduct the genetic profile. After considerable discussion, we agreed to have Mark continue to flesh out the details of this in the form of a study plan. Might we consider a phased approach? All agreed that, where possible, we would take advantage of collection efforts in other studies. We will discuss this further at our December meeting to determine next steps. In order to make predictions regarding future conditions of the Basin in the without project alternative we need to make some assumptions regarding how the project might be removed. Phil reported on a scenario to remove the dams that would be the most realistic way: You would start by removing Upper Baker dam (by tunneling around and once you get control of the water, take it out). The risk would be catastrophic sediment flush.  Baker River Project Relicense Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 11-14-02_Final_fishWG_notes; Lyn Wiltse  9 of 11   R-A38 Bull Trout Population Assessment & Risk Analysis  Lower Baker dam would need to stay up initially because it would act as a giant sediment trap. Lower Baker dam is sufficient to contain the entire bed load that would be released if the Upper Dam were removed. You could drop the water level at UB to minimum operating pool. Re-colonization of the inundation zone at Upper Baker would begin after you take out Upper Baker (probably would take 4-5 years for UB and 10 years for LB). The assumptions around this approach will be shared by the Terrestrial Working Group. Brady reported that he and Gene are working with Mark on re-working this Study Plan. Phil reported that FERC has asked PSE to prepare a Biological Assessment on how the proposed chinook measures in the IPP affect bull trout and bald eagles. This Biological Assessment is due by December 6. We'll get an update at our December meeting. Phil and Nick will meet by mid-January with Gene, Mark, Brady to coordinate Biological Assessment and A38.
