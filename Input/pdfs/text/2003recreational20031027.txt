Baker River Project Relicense, October 27, 2003 Meeting FERC Project NO. 2150 Lyn Wiltse for Recreation Resources Working Group  2   <b7> Chris, Jamie, EDAW folks: By November 21, prepare status of reports and email to Andy to distribute prior to our next meeting. <b7> Dave and Ann: By November 21, prepare status of KKOS and USFS Access Management EA and email to Andy to distribute prior to our next meeting so he can distribute to team members prior to Nov. 24 meeting. <b7> Ann: Check with RSO and RRM for overflow percentage for Horseshoe Cove (how it was reached, etc.) REPORT ON OLD ACTION ITEMS <b7> Andy: Sent R5 Survey Methodology (with locations) to Ann. <b7> Andy: Checked with Tony re: locations of Hamer fire ring sites. (See discussion below). <b7> All: Saw if you could attend the Terrestrial Working Group meeting at Mountlake Terrace on October 16 to review a mylar overlay map of the high, medium, and low erosion areas called out in the study to evaluate potential cross-resource considerations. (Andy will send out the invitation asap.) <b7> All: Got Andy your comments on R16: Needs Analysis by October 14. <b7> Andy: Saw that R9 Report (Electronic Monitoring) got posted to the website by October 6. <b7> Andy: Set up meeting with Jamie and Brian, then with Cary re: Lake Shannon Development Feasibility and access associated with it. <b7> Andy: Talked with Mark re: when he could get the R5 (Aesthetics) report out. <b7> Chris: Talked with Joetta re: priorities for Recreation Studies (R12 is first priority, then R11/15.) and got an idea of a schedule for next iteration of study reports. <b7> Andy: Sent out electronic copies of R13 comments/responses along with notification of conference call on September 26 from 10:00 to 1:00. <b7> Lyn: Checked with Team Leaders to see that all are handling conversion to NAVD '88 consistently. All reports are either using converted elevation data or noting the conversion in an errata sheet. UPDATE ON LAKE SHANNON DEVELOPMENT FEASIBILITY Andy and Jamie met with Brian Adams, Bob Vaux Skagit County Parks Director, and Patrick Dylan Parks Planner/Landscape Architect to show them the same presentation that Jamie did for this group last month. Based on their feedback, we will be narrowing the primary focus for this to the existing site and the 3 mile creek site (on the east side of the lake). Skagit County's core interest is to provide legal access to Lake Shannon to get boats on the Lake. Andy then met with Cary and Jamie to see if it would be feasible to put a boat launch on PSE property down at the forebay near the dam (across from the net pens). It appears that it wouldn't be possible to do this without "spilling onto" Glacier-owned lands. Glacier is concerned about liability issues around their quarry. There might also be noise and road conflicts. Andy will get together with Cary and Brian to discuss this further and report back at our next meeting. We also need to keep the perspective that the license will be 30-50 years in length. The quarry might not be in operation that long.  Baker River Project Relicense, October 27, 2003 Meeting FERC Project NO. 2150 Lyn Wiltse for Recreation Resources Working Group  3   Jamie is preparing a formal report on this.  REVIEW COMMENTS ON STUDIES  Study # Title  R-R5  Visuals and Aesthetics Study  R-7 R-9 R-11/15  Recreation Use Survey <ad> Literature Review Recreation Use Survey <ad> Electronic Monitoring Recreation Capacity and Suitability Analysis, Current draft April, 2003  Notes/Next Steps PRESENTATION ON R-5: VISUAL/AESTHETICS STUDIES Mark Greenig was unavailable today, so EDAW consultants Bill Spain and Michael Romero presented an update on the aesthetics/visual Resources report. Michael is a landscape architect and was responsible for the existing conditions inventory and description and did that portion of the presentation. Bill Spain is a recreational planner and was responsible to the recreation aesthetics survey. He presented that piece. They distributed hard copies of a PowerPoint presentation they prepared to guide this discussion. For this survey the USFS staff, PSE staff, and EDAW staff selected 28 photos to characterize the reservoir from a series of locations from various pool levels. Selected photos were randomly sequenced and placed into binders to be used during field work. This was done to decrease the likelihood that a respondent would recognize a scene at different pool levels. Bill distributed one of the binders used for team members to review. The survey staff ended up with 186 valid completed surveys. Scenes observed at all pool elevations were viewed positively. There was very weak positive correlation of .132, indicating only a very slight preference with higher pool elevations. The initial interpretation of results is that the Project is viewed positively by most users regardless of pool level, however there is a slight preference for higher pool levels. Tentative Schedule for report completion: 11-24-03: Draft to Group to review over 3 weeks 12-15-03: Group comments back to PSE 12-22-03: Final to PSE 1-2-04: Final to Louis Berger Andy will email this report to all team members along with the draft version of these notes. Subsumed in R14 study. This report is final and has been posted on the Baker relicensing website. Chris sent a request for map and table updates to R2. These should be ready by the end of October. Chris will then incorporate additional updates to complete these reports.  Baker River Project Relicense, October 27, 2003 Meeting FERC Project NO. 2150 Lyn Wiltse for Recreation Resources Working Group  4   R-12 R-13 R-14 R-16  Dispersed Site Inventory, Current draft April, 2003 Recreation Visitor Surveys, Current draft March, 2003 Secondary Data Collection Recreation Needs Analysis, Current draft April, 2003  We'll get an update of progress at our next meeting. (Combined with R11/15) Andy showed us a map of both reservoirs, according to terrestrial polygons showing fire rings in sites that weren't included in our dispersed site inventory. Note: These fire ring sites were discovered by Hamer Environmental folks who were on their hands and knees searching for rare plants. We don't have GPS locations for these fire rings. We only have identification of the polygon they belong to. Andy will review these maps in more detail. Assuming he finds nothing that needs our immediate attention, we agreed that our response would be to address these sites within the context of the annual dispersed site monitoring. There was a conference call on September 29 to address comments on this report. Based on these comments, we will re-process results of this report and edit the report text accordingly. We will get an update of where we are in this process. In the meantime, Chris will distribute the newly revised results file and begin editing the report thereafter. (Not discussed at 9/22 meeting.) Ongoing. Chris walked us through his responses to Ann's comments on this draft study report. Ann provided clarification as needed. Additionally, revision to the R16 report is dependent upon usable input from the aesthetics study and HYDROPS output for the proposed operation (pending resolution of the question of whether/how we present Information on future reservoir operations). Based on assumed resolution of that question at the November meeting and the assumed availability of aesthetics and HYDROPS results, mid-December will be the target for a revised R16 report.  STATUS OF FOREST SERVICE ACCESS MANAGEMENT EA Ann reported that the Forest Service is studying effects of various alternatives. They are looking at the Forest Service lands in the Baker Basin, including Road 12. Some areas of controversy are the roads and trail in the Rainbow Ridge, Swift Creek, Boulder Creek and Baker River areas. Ann will keep up posted. A14A: SHORELINE EROSION REVIEW Ann is talking with Greta about recreation concerns with high erosion sites. These will be addressed on a site-specific basis in an Erosion Management Plan. We will monitor rates of erosion overtime.  Baker River Project Relicense, October 27, 2003 Meeting FERC Project NO. 2150 Lyn Wiltse for Recreation Resources Working Group  5   KOMA KULSHAN OUTDOOR SCHOOL REPORT Dave reported that Christie Fairchild is putting together a report on the fall classes, which concluded October 18. He'll get this report out prior to our next meeting. We will entertain questions/comments at our November 24 meeting.
