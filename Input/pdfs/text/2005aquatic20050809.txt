JUVENILE FISH PASSAGE MIGRATION RESULTS  Doug reported that the Upper Baker and Lower Baker traps were shut down August 2. The Lower Baker guidenets have been removed; the Upper Baker gulper has been raised up and is undergoing maintenance in preparation for winter. Doug walked the group through the juvenile trap data (see handouts: "Baker Project Juvenile Fish Trap and Haul Results DRAFT" and "2005 UB-LB trap").  Total juvenile fish passage through Upper Baker was 147,276 and 8,207 at Lower Baker for a total of 155,483. Unmarked sockeye were considerably lower in numbers this year (87,804 at Upper Baker, 91,035 total). The numbers of sockeye fry (9,988) collected this year at Upper Baker increased and these fish were returned to Baker Lake. Their numbers increased toward the tail-off of the sockeye smolt outmigration timing curve. Their size was about 70-80 mm and scale samples from the earliest batch indicated zero-aged fish. PSE is requesting that the co-managers provide a direction for handling these fish (should they be returned to Baker Lake or sent downstream with the smolts) for next season. We may try giving these fish a salt-water challenge next season to investigate their smoltification state in the event that they are similarly high in numbers next season. We may also want to mark or tag these fish. Gary Sprague will bring data about juvenile sockeye survival related to size for our consideration.  Tables distributed on daily counts also included mark-recapture rates from reservoir study groups. Recapture rates at Upper Baker for marked coho ranged from 52-56 percent. This is very similar to what we have recorded over the last ten years. Recapture rates at Upper Baker for marked sockeye ranged from 28-32 percent. Marked sockeye comprise a larger group released in November and a smaller group released in April. The over-winter group continues to have promising survival. This sockeye ad-clip group was released as 50,000 and recovered at 28%; this is viewed as a good rate. PSE has been supporting the operations of the Little Park Creek smolt collection trap in recent years. Final season  Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 ARG FINAL Meeting Notes, August 9, 2005  Page 2 of 8   recapture rate was the highest recorded at 60%, since the study groups were initiated in 1998. The nearly 20% increase from last year posed the question -could this be the result, at least partially, from the NTS? There have been no other changes to the protocol. Finally, the recapture rates at Lower Baker for marked coho was 32 percent and is within the range of what we have recorded over the last ten years, though this years rate was higher than in recent years. We are using a 250' deep guide net this year instead of the 200' net used last year. Not sure if this has impacted the numbers. There was no spill at Upper Baker this year. All these data can be referred to in the handouts.  Along the lines of species handling protocols at the juvenile traps, Gary Sprague will come up with a directive for brook trout after coordinating with the other co-managers and bring this back to the group. A small number was collected at the Lower Baker juvenile trap. In the bigger picture, PSE suggested the co-managers formalize the protocol for all species to be handled through the juvenile facilities.

PSE found damage in the trap and made repairs and we are no longer seeing any fish injured this year.  We are also seeing really high water temperatures coming out of Lake Shannon (61 degrees when filling the transport tank from water out of the adult trap). They've been adding ice when transporting the fish to bring transport tank waters within 10 degrees difference from the spawning beach water where the fish are released. So far, there has been zero mortality. The sockeye return reached 3,000 this year. The lower return meant the goal was not achieved for loading the spawning beach and artificial incubation program (reached 60% of the goal this year). We're treating the brood stock twice a week with Formalin trying to keep them in the best possible shape.  Counters are being repaired and calibrated. Kevin brought comparison data on fry counts made in each spawning beach section and from the hopper dating back to brood year 1997. No trend was apparent. Kevin will number each counter to try to isolate the source of the counting issues. (Is there a malfunctioning counter or counters ... or are all counters unpredictably inaccurate?) We discussed various options to try to improve the accuracy of these data. Kevin suggested removing the hopper counter and using it as a back-up. Cary suggested it might be worth considering adding redundant counters (doubling the # of counters). We need to keep in mind what kinds of decisions we are making based on erroneous counter data. Kevin will explore "sandwiching" the counters together and will contact the supplier. Kevin will also get information on delivery of additional counters for back-up.  FISH REARING INVENTORIES & RELEASES Doug described the inventory of fish at the Upper Baker rearing facility; refer to the "Baker Project Fish  Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 ARG FINAL Meeting Notes, August 9, 2005  Page 3 of 8   Inventory" handout. Doug walked the group through the status of the fish at the facility and the planned marking groups, release times and locations.  <b7> There are nearly 60,000 sockeye juveniles. We'll begin clipping them the end of August; 5,000 will be used as a freeze-brand group. Others will be released in late October, early Nov. as ad-clipped sockeye.  <b7> There are 64,000 coho juveniles <ad> three groups of 5,000 will selected for mark recapture studies. <b7> Brood stock sockeye collection <ad> At 874 (this is low). These are on Formalin drip.  <b7> Received 20,000 rainbow trout from the Arlington hatchery. These fish are doing fine and will be moved in to circulars as soon as they are ready (probably in September). Will release the few remaining rainbow trout left from last year in the near future; they are held back for various fundraising events.

ADULT TRAP PROTOCOL UPDATE OR CHANGES There were no major changes to the trap protocol. It was clarified that the unmarked Chinook with coded-wire tags (these are mostly non Skagit, hatchery fish) do not need to be taken to Marblemount Hatchery for tag recovery. Tags from the unmarked Chinook that are collected are now recovered at the Baker Project.

If we get a lot of pinks that stray into the trap during fall 2005, we'll be putting them up at Baker Lake. Doug will alert the co-managers if we get up to 1,000 pinks coming into the Baker Adult Trap. Doug will also add a footnote to the protocol sheet that the development of the char protocol is in progress.  A Time for Honoring Gene Stagner's Retirement and Phil Hilgert's 50th Birthday!  Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 ARG FINAL Meeting Notes, August 9, 2005  Page 5 of 8   Introduction-Plan  Study-Methods  Test-Results  ARTICLE 101 <ad> FISH PROPAGATION FACILITIES Arnie reported that a list of rearing criteria was developed based on standard hatchery references, WDFW sources and Baker hatchery information, and we are underway in the production planning which will lead to the point of developing conceptual facility lay-outs this fall. Chris Beasley and Mike McGowan walked us through a PowerPoint presentation of Rearing Criteria and Production Analysis for the Baker hatchery. The aim is for the facility to yield 7 million Sockeye fry with 20,000 pound instantaneous production. This PowerPoint presentation handout will be emailed to the group.  They are aiming to build a facility that will provide maximum flexibility. The size of the site is limited. We do have a good water supply. This includes good pressure, good flow, etc. We need to plan carefully how to transition from the spawning beaches when we work on improving the beaches.  They anticipate being at 15% draft design level by the end of the year.  RELICENSE STUDIES UPDATE: A-38 NATIVE CHAR INVESTIGATIONS (PRELIM. 2005 FIELD RESULTS) Phil reported on what has been done through 2005 so far. Snorkeling surveys of the Upper Baker River and Sulphur Creek are set to start this month (August). Doug reported that we are currently gathering biological data on each native char from Baker Lake, Lake Shannon, and Lower Baker River Adult Trap collections. So far this year, we have 43 samples. The plan is to submit them to the WDFW lab along with batches from Marblemount and other parts of the region so they can be processed all at once.  A-09 INSTREAM FLOW (DRAFT REPORT <ad> PROGRESS UPDATE) Phil reported there has been little progress since our last meeting. We'll get an update from him on this at our September 21st meeting.  FISH PASSAGE TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP REPORT Nick reported that there have been considerable cost increases (more than doubling projected costs at the time of the settlement). These increases are tied to the size and complexity of the Floating Surface Collector. PSE has responded to this challenge by conducting three types of peer review: <b7> Value Engineering (VE), <b7> Engineering Design Review, and <b7> Independent Consultant Review Pending the results of these reviews, the last two Fish Passage Technical Working Group meetings have  Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 ARG FINAL Meeting Notes, August 9, 2005  Page 6 of 8   been cancelled.  The first stage of the VE design review was held a couple weeks ago. The second stage will occur next week. This review is being held concurrently with the two other design reviews. As soon as a design/redesign is selected, the Fish Passage Technical Working Group will resume meeting.  Major contributions to the increased costs included increased cost of steel, amount of steel required, pumps, launch site, etc. Schedule implications are unknown at this point. Alternative construction and launch methods are being considered. In the next month, a decision about the launch site will be made. It is unlikely that the Working Group will meet in September, as PSE and Montgomery Watson will be busy conducting constructability reviews of the reports from the VE session as well as the other two design reviews at that time. Nick will keep us posted.  UPDATE FROM JUNE BRICC MEETING Jamie and Lyn briefly highlighted the June Meeting of the BRICC (Baker River Interim Coordinating Committee) from the meeting notes. Steve Hawking of FERC notified PSE that they will be issuing a DEIS - Draft Environmental Impact Statement - (as opposed to a DEA). Their intent was to issue the DEIS by the end of July; Steve called shortly thereafter to say that they would be late. Due to ex parte rules, he was unable to provide more detail than that. At his suggestion, we have cancelled the scheduled the August 18th meeting; he suggested we keep the September 20th meeting on our calendars. The 30-day comment period will begin when the DEIS is issued.  FERC has a new chairman and is in transition. Steve's best guess at this point is that this delay will not impact the overall schedule. Permitting delays may delay the schedule. Connie Freeland will be trying to set up a meeting for various BRICC members to meet with the Town of Concrete, Skagit & Whatcom Counties, and DOE to review the contents of the Settlement Agreement in hope that this will facilitate the timely issuance of shoreline and other related permits.
