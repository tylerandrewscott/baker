BRICC / LICENSE UPDATE Cary Feldmann reported on the first video-conference call with locations in Bellevue, Tacoma, and Burlington for the July meeting. Other than some audio problems at the Tacoma location, the trial went well. The updated version of the decision-making protocol was reviewed at the meeting. FERC has received the Bi-Op from NMFS. Paul Wetherbee will be contacting them re: the schedule for issuing the license. We are anticipating getting the license by the end of October. In the meantime, resource groups are meeting regularly in anticipation of receiving the license then. Once the license is issued, there is a 30-day appeal period for us to compare it to the settlement agreement and ensure our interests are preserved. Participants have the option to appeal parts of or the whole license or to request a stay. With the strength of 4(e) conditions demonstrated with Cushman, we are cautiously optimistic that the terms of the settlement agreement will be represented in the license. Participants were encouraged to get on FERC’s email notification list. PSE will also keep participants informed of the notifications they receive. DOWNSTREAM FISH PASSAGE FACILITIES The following updates were based upon several table handouts that were provided. Doug reviewed the 2008 numbers for the Upper Baker juvenile trap. There were 18,575 juvenile Coho. This was the lowest number since 1987. This was still pretty good considering these are progeny from a low Coho return (965) in 2006. There were 209,000 unmarked sockeye. This was second largest number ever. There were 46,000 marked sockeye, bringing the total sockeye to 255,000. This was the second largest ever (the largest occurred in 2006). There was some discussion about the emergence of “smaller” (estimated around 90 mm) juvenile sockeye smolts at the trap during the tail end of the outmigration season and whether or not these fish are subyearlings. Going forward we will enumerate and collect scales and lengths from these fish. There was a 60% recovery of Coho marked recapture groups – this was pretty good, with the new FSC. Doug reported we had low recovery at Lower Baker. He also reported net damage was found on the Lower Baker guidenets which have since been remedied. He did not know of the duration and timing of the damage or the impact it may have had on the recapture. The Sockeye Reservoir Migration Study showed a 74.8% recovery of the “backwards C” branded fish. This has the highest percentage on record. There was an 80% recovery of ad-clipped fish – some of those were pit tagged. These numbers will be adjusted when R2 Consultants finishes their analysis of the study. Doug estimates the final number will be Baker River Project Relicense ARG Final Meeting Notes 9/9/08  FERC Project No. 2150 Page 2 of 7   about 76%. Since the season is over the FSC has been taken out of service and we are in the process of completing work in it that had been deferred (e.g., painting). We are also performing other modifications and improvements with hopes of finishing before the start of the rainy season. The recovery rate and our ability to sample has already been much improved with FSC, and should improve even further. SOCKEYE SPAWNING BEACH AND ARTIFICIAL INCUBATION OPS Kevin reported we didn’t quite reach our expected loading goal to the Spawning Beach and AI program this year. We were approximately 61% of the goal. But Kevin is optimistic that we will be alright with numbers of fry from the AI program. Everything else is going well. We will be putting together spawning supplies next week. All were asked to be prepared to discuss emptying strategies for the beach and what to do with counters at our November meeting. The adult sockeye returns to Baker Lake and Lake Washington were 400% lower than preseason forecasts, apparently as a result of extremely poor ocean survival conditions, especially for the smolts. The Fraser River runs were also very poor, but in contrast, the Columbia River sockeye run was very good. We will take standard IHN and otolith samples of adults according to the protocol. We discussed how we might want to hold early returning fish at the ponds, ear-marked for allocation to Baker Lake while the prognosis of the run is evaluated, in case the run falls short of expectation. The comanagers will set up a meeting to address the strategy for lake plants of Baker sockeye adults. FISH REARING INVENTORIES AND RELEASES Doug referred to the inventory handout for the following rearing program census. Doug explained that currently Raceway 1 contains 65,000 sockeye. We will soon finish sockeye ad-clipping and move on to Coho. We will hold some for the biological evaluation study. The fall release group had high survival. Approximately 50,000 will be released in November when water temperatures drop sufficiently. We will take 100 scales and lengths prior to releasing them. We will discuss this further at our October meeting. Other highlights of his report:  Trout pond - 797 brood stock  Small circulars – 3 groups of Rainbow from the Arlington Hatchery.  There are 9 Coho brood stock in the large circular #3.  We will start spawning them in mid-November and will also use circular #4 for that.  The goal for adult Coho broodstock is 200. CHANGES TO ADULT TRAP PROTOCOL  No changes for Coho/sockeye  Chinook – unmarked, no CWT (wild fish) protocol remains the same.  August 16-Sept. 1 will operculum punch  Sept. 25 – will start taking fish for brood stock purposes. Will take one out of every two wild fish for brood stock – operculum punch them and return to river. Baker River Project Relicense ARG Final Meeting Notes 9/9/08  FERC Project No. 2150 Page 3 of 7           Chinook unmarked and CWT no changes. Chinook ad-clipped and CWT fish will do DNA sampling – will take 20% for brood stock. We will continue to sample 20% for CWTs to get a better distribution throughout the run. Natural run Steelhead (combining summer and winter runs) – no changes. Hatchery run Steelhead combined to a single column – no changes. No protocol changes for other species. Native char – development of future protocol is in progress.  HATCHERY DESIGN UPDATE Dave Jenness explained that we are in the process of finalizing 100% design which will be submitted on September 22. We will do a 100% design review at our October 14th ARG meeting. October 20 will be the PSE Internal Design review meeting. Next phase: Signed, stamped drawings. We are in the permitting process with Whatcom County. We are anticipating getting the license the end of October. Weather permitting, we will start site grading in March of 2009. Mort McMillen walked us through an overview of the changes made since the 90% design review:  Truck loading location was changed  Able to keep 2 of the 3 circulars and all of the vinyl raceways  Roof was extended on hatchery  Moved location of storage buildings They are currently adding a lot of detail that typically gets overlooked in construction including where electrical panels are, how all the piping works, etc. Submittal Includes  Design drawings  Tech specs  DDR Report  Appendices A-K  Revised Design Criteria Package in Appendix A  Responses to comments in Appendix J (responses to all 1300 comments received – incorporated 1200 of these into the new design) After getting the license, will incorporate any additional permit conditions and then be ready to go to construction. Schedule Highlights  Mobilize - Feb 2009  Start construction – Mar 2009  First shutdown May 2009  Main hatchery construction June 2009 to Mar 2010  Main hatchery testing Mar – Apr 2010  Second shut down May 2010 Baker River Project Relicense ARG Final Meeting Notes 9/9/08  FERC Project No. 2150 Page 4 of 7      Spawning Beach Modifications – June – November 2010 Construction complete November 2010  2 Issues from Meetings with WDFW 1. Formalin (suggested changes were incorporated) 2. AI holding spawning design – layout of the spawning facility – looking at Issaquah hatchery 14% reduction in holding volume if incorporate Issaquah design Slope floor and lower water depth in spawning area Mort showed pictures of the Issaquah hatchery operation and explained the main differences in this design and what we have planned for Baker. 3 Alternatives considered and evaluated: 1. Maintain AI holding spawning design as per DCP 2. Adopt Issaquah Hatchery Layout – matching existing water surface 3. Adopt Issaquah Hatchery Layout – match finish grade The most labor-intensive part of a hatchery is spawning. WDFW is looking at doing everything possible to make this process easy and convenient. How much free-board do we need for jump prevention – 3 or 4 feet? Inflow is from the floor, so they wouldn’t typically be jumping anyway. People seemed to feel that 3 feet would be sufficient. Mort outlined the pros and cons of 3 different alternatives that came out of WDFW’s suggestion that we incorporate the sloped floor design of the Issaquah hatchery. This should result in less O&M cost. Jed reported his observation at Issaquah that fish don’t seem to be influenced by the sloped floor and have held in the 3’ shallow end. He believes the impact of incorporating the Issaquah design should not be problematic to the fish. Response to ARG Comments Mort summarized his responses to the following comments from the ARG  Complete additional evaluation ensuring storm water does not enter the ponds – addressed.  Add windows to provide natural light in the hatchery building – windows were added to the extent possible.  Provide screen slots in the adult pond to facilitate fry rearing – done.  Provide smooth ramp in the spawning beach banks to facilitate capture and removal of adults – done. Next Steps: Cost out the 3 alternatives from construction and O&M perspectives. There seems to be consensus to incorporate the Issaquah Hatchery sloped floor alternatives. We will continue to look at other implications / unintended consequences of this proposed design change.

Nick reported that the FPTWG will resume meeting again September 26 and will be reviewing the FSC performance evaluation study results and developing the 2009 study as well. PSE has initiated in-house discussions for the Lower Baker FSC to be operational in 2012. The design of this FSC will also be discussed as will connectivity and the schedule for the adult trap. Post-season work is now being done on Upper Baker FSC. We will discuss FSC performance at our October meeting. Anyone interested in attending the September 26 FPTWG (at SEATAC) meeting should let Nick know so he can provide necessary information. OTHER LICENSE IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES Arnie reviewed briefly the proposed plan format for FERC reporting. The idea is to keep decisions at the appropriate local level. FERC would approve the processes and be informed later about the actual actions. This standardized template would be used for plans across all working groups (with the exception of CRAG). Draft reports will be reviewed periodically at these meetings. We have initiated Middle Skagit spawning surveys in accordance with the Interim Protection Plan. Phil announced that they plan on flying Thursday, Sept. 11, and doing a jet boat survey the following day. We look forward to reviewing the end-of-the-year report. Phil reported that native char tissue samples from past studies are currently being analyzed at the WDFW genetics center. There was great rejoicing. We are planning for two more years of study on connectivity between Lake Shannon and Baker Lake. Terrestrial Activities TRIG elk habitat acquisition – Cary reported that PSE has made an offer on a parcel. The land acquisition teamlet is still putting together the protocol to guide acquisitions. Smolt Capacity Study Arnie reported that the teamlet for the smolt capacity study will be convening shortly and we will get an update at our October meeting.
