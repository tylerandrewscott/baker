In conclusion, no cause-effect relationship was would likely lead to identified, although mild correlations were noted. modification of pass designs.

There is meet with Brian therefore no way to account for slight data discrepancies when trap (MWH), Sue and Ph sampling does not occur every day. These discrepancies are likely (R2). to be minimal, because the trap is sampled every day during the migration peak (i.e., when there are five or more fish observed in the trap). The data set was inclusive of June 1990 to December 2001. Pearson Correlation Coefficients Table 2 was examined with group. Looked at flows but also looked at % of flow from Skagit River and Baker River. Purpose of the analysis was to address transport, Baker River flow control and trap attraction. Mainly wanted to determine temperature effects and flow effects on upstream migrations. Temperature analysis will be conducted when sufficient data are collected. Definitions of variables are explained within the document. Jim suggested using hourly flow data versus hourly trap data. Hourly trap data is not available, and using hourly flow data versus daily trap data would likely be misleading. Stan suggested looking only at days when generation was started after minimum flows were in place for a period of time, and looking at periods when flow is under 1000 cfs. It was also suggested to look at on- generation peaking operation vs. no-generation compared with daily trap counts. The fact that no cause-effect relationship was identified during this Filename: Baker Passage Minutes 04 02 2002 2 of 6 Item Description Description Action, By analysis suggests that a variety of other combination analyses may be of little use, so nothing further will be done at this point. Ken recommended moving further study review and consideration to the flow issues technical working group. The group agreed. 4.4 Technical Memo Discussed Mort’s memoranda tracking system that lists memos, Mort - Include date Tracking Log alternative status, and filter and design processes. and most recent Tracking memo contains summary of all alternatives, as well as revision number in separate sheets to track technical memoranda chronologically by summary alternative submittal date. tables.

Rev. 1 LB FL.3 Comments: Weirs may need a bottom opening or perforations to create uniform vertical flow. Also need to consider how water will flow across screens if one pump goes out. It was agreed that for this level of analysis the alternative would be accepted until further information is received from results of the biological studies. The group also agreed that 1000 cfs is the maximum size of a surface attraction system due to physical size, power consumption and system complexity. 4.6 Review of MIS / 60% Flow / High Velocity Nick – coordinate v alternative LB FL.7 Alternative based upon Howard Hansen Dam, which has a design of Howard Hansen flow of 1000 cfs and where they are pushing issues pretty far to physical model after the limits of what is practical. Consider a physical model for this May meeting. design option. Screen 30 feet long 16 feet wide. Ed suggested consideration of a design similar to that at Howard Hansen. The sectional design was reviewed. This alternative may work with a full reservoir, but has limitations with pool fluctuation ranges similar to existing. Ed asked whether it was possible to fix the screen module at a lower elevation as moving screens to track the water surface elevation could be a problem. Fixing the screen poses some risk due to the requirement of fish coming in at the surface and then having to sound as much as 100’ to enter the screen. A lifting device instead of a float is used at Howard Hansen. Also consider putting screens in a vertical arrangement and use one Filename: Baker Passage Minutes 04 02 2002 3 of 6 Item Description Description Action, By lifting device. Consider 6 fps velocity at throat, 2 fps at screen. Bypass flow - consider trapping velocity, so look at 7 fps. Then consider size of pipe to preclude trapping debris. Then need a dewatering screen and direct fish into a raceway. Consider 500 cfs and modification with fixed screen criteria and variable (moving screen) criteria. The Howard Hansen facility will be complete in 2006, so PSE could use their operational experience when ready to finalize this design if carried forward. Ed assumes that we are dealing with fry of 40 to 60 mm size. If fry size is 100 mm then a higher velocity screen could be used, although we don’t want to preclude future options. Elwha uses a 9’ diameter penstock, while Howard Hansen has a 16’ diameter penstock, and this is considered too large. We may want to consider stacking several smaller penstocks and screens instead of having one large one, especially if constructability issues arise. Ken suggested that success depends on width and length of screens, so a tower should have ports that channel flow into the bypass and then into the penstock. One problem with a vertical arrangement is access to the screen. A horizontal arrangement may be more operationally feasible. Ed suggested we consider Greenpeter Dam, where they have a similar system and operations concerns. Mort has requested a study of Greenpeter from the library. Don wants to consider different velocities for different fish. Group agreed, stating that the design would accommodate the limiting velocity, i.e., the weakest swimming fish likely to encounter the screen. Ed suggested consideration of a fixed screen with multiple, selective bypass and withdrawal points. Cleaning will be accomplished by use of backflow through rotated screens Need to consider effects of surge from load rejection. Consider touring Howard Hansen physical model.

It is a very long distance limitations with Filename: Baker Passage Minutes 04 02 2002 4 of 6 Item Description Description Action, By from top to bottom. This is a very challenging alternative due to its structural engineer. size. There is a threshold for size, but a full 5000-cfs structure cantilevered off the dam appears impossible. The dam is designed to hold water back, not to take load in the reverse direction. For next iteration, consider issues such as how to direct and crowd fish. 4.8 Advancement of Mort reviewed log of TM’s. Some of the alternatives are pending Mort – continue Lower Baker development of similar simpler alternatives, i.e., F.2 to F.8, advancing design Alternatives depends upon development of F.1. Mort will advance design of alternatives LB F.9 alternatives LB F.9 & F.10, LB FL.6 & FL.7 F.10, LB FL.6 & FL for next meeting. 4.9 Destination Matrix The current work done on the destination matrix was presented. . Possible destinations for each species were taken and compared with the timing of the associated species to develop the number of Kim - E-mail matrix holding ponds required. Kim discussed use of matrix as basis of spread sheets to grou design for trap and haul. There are often many destinations and for for review. the majority of the year very few fish. Holding pond must be Also consider adding sized for the maximum number of fish arriving in a given period holding areas for dise of time, however flexibility must be taken into account in the final treatment. design. Ken suggested holding tanks on trucks when ponds are up to capacity in holding facilities. Gary would like to see consideration be given to disease treatment, such as vaccinations, which could require another holding tank. 4.10 Discussion of Don – research basis o Tram and Fish Lock The discussion centered around tram alternatives rather than fish tram at Cowlitz and Alternative locks, which are considered very complex without much gain current status. due to the difficulty of construction at the base of Baker Dam. Both tram and lock systems will require extensive modification Don is to report back of the current barrier dam. regarding TU position removal of ladder The current tram alternative was presented . Comments tended alternative. He asked to compare this alternative with the current truck system of That research on transport. Ken Bates mentioned that there are also possibilities Existing trams be of greater consequences with the failure of a tram, as opposed to Presented that of a truck. A truck is easy to repair as opposed to a complex fixed system such as a tram. Also, it is difficult to determine if there are any biological benefits of a tram vs. a truck. Mort – Advance designs U2.1 & U2.2, . Issues with a tram system center around the fact that at present U3.1 & U3.2 for the there is no species, aside from trout species, that one would May 7 meeting. consider placing into Lake Shannon, and transport of any species can still be accomplished with a truck. Gary pointed out to Don that there is very little spawning area in Lake Shannon. Don thinks the streams coming into Lake Shannon could make good spawning grounds, which Gary disagrees. Those streams are steep, more vertical than horizontal. Design of alternatives U2.1 & U2.2, U3.1 & U3.2 will be advanced for the next meeting.
