REVIEW OF AGENDA, NOTES, HANDOUTS The August 11, 2009 Draft ARG Meeting notes were approved with minor edits. BRCC / LICENSE PROCESS UPDATE Cary Feldmann reported that the last time the BRCC met was April 22. The next meeting will be September 23 in the Summit Room (2nd floor) of the PSE Building in Bellevue. It will be followed by an article-by-article description of the license to ensure a common understanding among all Baker license implementation participants. All are welcome. This will help with new members as well as serve as a refresher for “old” members. Cary suggested that this will likely be an annual process. The meeting will start at 9:00. Cary also reported that as we are nearing our first year since license issuance, there are many plans out for review. The various resource groups are sending the plans out to members first for informal review, with the idea that by the time of the official review all comments would have been addressed. The plans will be submitted to FERC by October 1. ARTICLE 107c Teamlet Report At the February 10, 2009 ARG Meeting Mark Killgore discussed with ARG members water and flood related issues. His role at PSE is to act as corporate liaison to USACE and be responsible for flood-related aspects in the Baker license. He explained that License Article 107c requires PSE to define imminent flood management. The report is due to FERC October 1, 2011. At the ARG October 13 meeting, Mark and Kathy will discuss past events and how drawdown was done. PSE is convening a teamlet to see how we can reach agreement about procedures and operations to respond to an imminent flood event. We are looking at creating extra storage in the Project in response to a forecast of an imminent flood. At future ARG meetings Mark explained that teamlet meetings would be held on the heels of ARG meetings as interested parties would already be there. The teamlet would discuss flow and ramping restrictions during spawning period and conditions under which those restrictions are released. There would be post-flood as well as real-time interface with the ARG. Article 107(c) & 4.1.1 – Cooperation regarding Flood Storage - Drawdown Target Elevation -- 107(c) involves consultation to address imminent floods. PSE will submit a report to the Commission within 3 years of license issuance on this Cooperation during flood control Baker River Project License Implementation FERC Project NO. 2150 ARG Conference Call Final Meeting Notes 9/8/09 Page 2 of 4 -- 4.1.1 deals with target elevations. PSE traditionally has used the lower targets to provide a little buffer 704.92 instead of 711.56 ft. at Upper Baker. 423.66 ft. is the drawdown target for Lower Baker. -- 4.1.2 deals with amendments to the Water Control Manual (USACE). A letter was recently sent to the USACE suggesting edits to their Water Control Manual. PSE, Skagit County, and the tribes participated in the drafting of the request in compliance with the Settlement Agreement regarding these articles. Mark walked us through a high-level Process Diagram – Imminent Flood Management (Baker License Article 107c – Flood Storage, dated August 28, 2009. He explained that this is geared toward big events in 20 – 100 year range. It is not geared toward PMF or 1000 year floods. The aim of the process is to get consensus on a procedure in time to submit the report to FERC by October 1, 2011. The Northwest River Forecast Center has much more accurate forecasts than what were available in 1995 due to advances in technology. Arn explained there may be some benefit to higher flows in that floods can create channel forming processes. This is secondary consideration. Kathy walked us through various detailed flow diagrams. She reminded all that someone at PSE is watching the Northwest River Forecast at all times, so they have a good idea if a storm is likely to occur. She explained that PSE monitors other rivers in addition to the Skagit. They also look at the Sauk, Stillaguamish, and the Nooksack. Precipitation being recorded at various SNOTEL stations. This helps them better predict the volume, the timing, and the peak of the storm. They issue updates through their communications matrix internally and externally. PSE meets with the Corps along with Seattle City Light and Skagit County the beginning of each October to discuss what the fall and winter are likely to bring in terms of weather. In addition to PSE’s staff Mark Killgore, Kathy Kimbell, Arnie Aspelund and consultant Phil Hilgert, members of the ARG Imminent Flood Management teamlet will include Stan, Bob H, Chuck, and Lorna. They will meet from 1:30 – 3:30 immediately following the October 13 ARG meeting in Mill Creek. OTHER LICENSE IMPLEMENTATION UPDATES Article 101 Draft Fish Propagation Facilities Plan Update The updated version of the plan dated August 31, 2009 was sent out by Arnie in a Sept. 2, 2009 email. The content is essentially unchanged from the time it went out initially for formal review. The format has been revised slightly and Section 9 was added to show responses to all comments received on the plan. After brief discussion, ARG members agreed to have PSE send the plan to FERC. (See decision noted on page 1 of these notes.) Article 110 Draft Reservoir Shoreline Erosion Control Management Plan The Shoreline Erosion Plan is due to FERC by October 1, 2009. Cary explained that after receiving comments on the plan from the USFS, they suggest requesting a one-year extension to file the plan. That Baker River Project License Implementation FERC Project NO. 2150 ARG Conference Call Final Meeting Notes 9/8/09 Page 3 of 4 will allow them sufficient time to get this plan completed. Cary explained that this was the only article that was changed by FERC from what was in the Settlement. FERC added Lake Shannon to the article. Article 505 Draft Aquatic Riparian Habitat Protection, Restoration and Enhancement Plan The Preliminary draft of the plan for Article 505 is out for preliminary review. All are to get their comments to Jacob by October 30, 2009. The plan is due to FERC in October of 2010. FLOOD CONTROL AGREEMENT Chuck announced that the USACE has finalized the long-term agreement for maintaining flood control.
