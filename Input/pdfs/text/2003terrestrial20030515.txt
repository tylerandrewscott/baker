Tom reported that we have all the information we need on this. Laura is satisfied with the report. • ALL: Reviewed T2, 5, 7b, 16, 17 and gave comments on these reports by our May 15 meeting. PDEA Update The initial partial PDEA (existing conditions) went out for Solution Team review on May 1. Anyone who has comments can get them to Tony by May 30. Next steps will be to revise existing conditions section and then do the effects section. They will use a specific operations scenario with the PMEs. PSE will provide Louis Berger this scenario by June 1. The “no action” (existing project) alternative will be the baseline. The effects section will be listed by issue based by resource. FERC’s view of the sufficiency of the applicant’s proposal will be determined by mitigation on resources for operations effects. We will also show other Basin-wide concerns and how they are being addressed. The de-commissioning scenario will be listed as an alternative “considered but eliminated from detailed study”. A without project scenario is necessary for the USFWS to use for Section 7 of the ESA. There are two ways to look at without project: 1. What would things look like if the project had never been built; 2. What would things look like if we removed the project? Gene will let us know what he needs on this by the next meeting. Regarding the preparation of the next draft PDEA (scheduled to be out in early August for internal review and then out in late September for the official 90-day review), we agreed to have the Louis Berger Group use the initial draft actions, also known as the “Duck” for the next draft of the PDEA. In the meantime, we will continue to finish up studies and work on the Settlement Agreement. BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 5/15/2003 MEETING NOTES Page 3 of 8 Lyn Wiltse for Terrestrial Technical Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150 Note from Stan (We called him on break). “This is the applicant’s proposal and is not agreed to by all in the process. Negotiations (RESOLVE process) with the agencies are still underway.” We intend to work with each other and not make “end runs” to each other’s bosses during the RESOLVE process. We also need to be really clear about the license article language before it goes to attorneys. We need to be sure that the intent isn’t lost in any lawyer “translations” or edits. We will need some norms around RESOLVE sessions to deal with the need to find ways to represent the interests of absent members when decisions/agreements are made. We decided to begin holding separate RESOLVE sessions, starting in June. See the list of dates at the beginning of these minutes. ISSUES TO RESOLVE AT JUNE MEETING (from 8:30 to 12:30) • Mountain Goat • Format and Content of Terrestrial Management Plan • Old Growth Forests • Review Initial License Article Language (drafted by Kathy) • 1.3.1 Provide nest structures for osprey at Lake Shannon • 1.3.4 Support the development of bald eagle nest management plans • 1.1.2 Evaluate the potential for establishing beneficial vegetation in the fluctuation zones PROJECT-INDUCED RECREATION QUESTION We will be getting copies of a white paper written by Chris Lawson on this topic. It includes a recommended range of “project relatedness” of various recreation sites. This will have implications for elk and mountain goats. HYDROPS UPD ATE PSE is in the process of testing the latest (and final) beta version of the HYDROPS software. They expect to be processing working group requests for runs by early June. STUDIES Study Title Notes/Next Steps # T2 Vegetation Mapping in Project Includes T5. Tony reported that PSE has decided to update Area the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) to the 1988 reference. This means a change of plus 3.77 feet at Upper Baker and plus 3.75 feet at Lower Baker. Joetta is aware of this change. For this study, this will mean a larger area of lacustrine (mostly in gentle slope areas) and a smaller area above full pool in our survey area. (T7 and T7b acreage numbers will also change. Stay tuned for further implications. T4 Analysis Species Assessment Carex flava is out for review. BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 5/15/2003 MEETING NOTES Page 4 of 8 Lyn Wiltse for Terrestrial Technical Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150 The sphagnum bog ecosystem analysis/literature review is also out. Two beetles: Awaiting input from experts. This should be out by the end of May. These conclude our species analysis assessments! Next Steps: Tony will bring a box of these papers along with finished reports to future meetings. T5 Wetland Inventory Study This is combined with T-2. See above. T6 Noxious Weed Assessment and These surveys are starting in June. They are getting together Control Plan site identification maps, etc. We will review maps and survey methods with Laura before starting the survey. T7 Historic Vegetation of the UB This study is complete and has been approved. Marty will and LB Projects produce a new final report with revised numbers (NAVD) by the June meeting. T7b Future vegetation mapping Marty reported that other than editing the numbers to align with the NAVD, this report is complete. He will have the NAVD changes made by our June meeting and bring a new hard copy with the new numbers to that meeting for our review. All were asked to get Marty comments on this report by our June meeting. T-9,10 Recreation use, effects on Mt. Did not discuss at this meeting. Don has drafted a PME for Goat Habitat use our review with regard to mountain goats. T11 Oregon Spotted Frog Inventory This study is complete and has been approved. R-T12 Grizzly Bear Spring Foraging Ron expects to get the sampling data by early June for Habitat Value analysis. He will need a database for queries on plants and weights. Tom is building the database for him. Sampling is underway for 5 cover types and 24 polygons. We expect to finish by the 1st week in June (on schedule). Tom reports they should be able to start drying pretty much right away (within 24 hours) after they resolve the Scirpus issue (difficult to distinguish in the early growth stage). They are currently air drying the samples according to methods suggested by John Cook. T13 Survey and Manage Terrestrial This study is complete and has been approved. Mollusk Survey T15 Basin Vegetation Mapping This is complete. It helped us identify critical information for grizzly and elk studies. An additional use for this data set might be helping us understand how many acres of riparian habitat are available for different stream classes. T16 Project Area Rare Plant Survey We have surveyed wetlands that we know have a hydrologic connection to the project (Category A and B). During this survey some category C wetlands were also surveyed. The survey person suspected that those wetlands listed as not connected to the reservoir may, indeed be connected (due to her field observations). This could also be BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 5/15/2003 MEETING NOTES Page 5 of 8 Lyn Wiltse for Terrestrial Technical Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150 due to some wetland identification protocols between Hamer and AESI. We agreed that AESI will re-visit all Category C wetlands with Level 2 confidence (where 2 = uncertain). If AESI decides to change their confidence to Level 1, they will provide documentation to explain why. If AESI is still uncertain, rare plant surveys will be done during the summer of 2003. AESI will make their assessment when reservoir is at full pool or by June 7, whichever comes first. Any wetlands they still have doubts about will be surveyed this summer. Tony will keep us updated through email before starting. WNHP rare plant data has been received and is being put into the report. Laura suggests we use the WNHP buffer protocol for showing locations of rare plants in the report that goes to the public. We will use more specific data for our own purposes. Any additional rare plant sitings will be addenda to the report, or we could finalize the report with this year’s data. Tom will address this with Joetta. Next Steps: Review maps and survey methods with Laura before starting the survey. Do also for supplemental rare plants and T6 noxious weeds. T17 Amphibian Studies in Reservoir Phase 1: What was found (existing conditions) Fluctuation Zone Tom distributed an egg mass table that will be integrated into this phase of the report. Phase 2: Possible Project Effects. There is not yet consensus on how the project effects section of the report was written. It was suggested that it may be more appropriate to include some of the language here in an appendix rather than as a project conclusion in the main body of the report. Kathy asked if we could call out suitable habitat locations and the approximate number of acres? We will discuss this further (with Don) at our June 19 meeting. R-T18 Breeding Bird Surveys Did not discuss at this meeting. (Combined with T-19.) R-T19 Habitat Evaluation Studies Did not discuss at this meeting. RT21 Elk studies Tony reported that we are on schedule to look at results by the end of June. The DNR data issue is resolved. We will have the data normalized by 5/16. Ron’s new phone # is 206-267-7741 RT22 Fluctuation Zone Enhancement We will go forward with this as part of a PME. RT23 Sphagnum Bog Survey AESI set up monitoring devices at different elevations in the WB-30 Bog. They have buttoned up with Lauri and Tony BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 5/15/2003 MEETING NOTES Page 6 of 8 Lyn Wiltse for Terrestrial Technical Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150 on this and are drafting a bog monitoring plan for working group review.
