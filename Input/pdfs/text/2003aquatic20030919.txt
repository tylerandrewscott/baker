Notes from RESOLVE Meetings To permit the greatest degree of open dialogue, the group agreed that notes for the RESOLVE sessions will be less formal than regular working group meetings. We will primarily document agreements and action items. RESOLVE Groundrules • Work at understanding one another. • Use airtime wisely. • Speak honestly and respectfully. • Examine assumptions. • Make tentative agreements, then look at the whole package together. • One meeting review rule: we have one meeting to review and change the tentative agreements of the previous RESOLVE session.1 1 All agreements are tentative even after the “one meeting review rule”. However, the one meeting rule gives regular participants an opportunity to bring an agreement back to the table while assuring that tentative agreements are not forever reopened. It also accommodates regular participants who must miss a meeting and may want to weigh in on a decision.

Review of PME’s Discussed To Date Note: In this meeting, we were working from 4rd draft PME’s dated September 19, 2003. 3.4.3: Erosion Management • PSE needs to review this in more detail to see “what we’re signing up for”. 3.2.1: Propagation: Additional Agreements • Regarding having 20,000 pound maximum capacity, we are getting comfortable with this amount. • Regarding sturgeon, we don’t know enough about the results of sturgeon introduction into the system. This might be a research project for the future, but shouldn’t be included in the current PME’s. • Regarding Steve’s paper, what additional fisheries program would require more than at 20,000 pound capacity? (Let Steve know if such a program is out there). • Change Operations Plan (page 43 of the 9/19 draft) to include supplementation facilities as well as spawning beaches. • Other wording changes were suggested and will be incorporated (regarding operations and contracting). • PSE, in consultation with the co-managers and with input from the BRCC, will develop a sub- basin fisheries and hatchery plan. 3.4.1: Fluvial Geomorphic Management: Additional Agreements • Stan will check on whether this PME is sufficient from perspective of the tribes. • Lower Baker actions are still sort of broad and vague. We may not have enough information— e.g., the Corps is still in feasibility study phase of Little Baker project—to make this more specific. • Lower Baker Channel modification—is this an alternative? • Defer this discussion regarding Lower Baker until A 16 is more refined (November?) 3.1.1: HERC Fund Purposes • A pot of money to deal with unforeseen circumstances and issues • For things that we may know the issue but not ways to spend money on the issue • Don’t want this to become a “procrastination fund” • Flexible money that we can shift from one area to another without going through FERC • A way to address “how to do the right thing for the Basin” • Avoid disputes later on (decreases likelihood of a re-opener) Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Aquatics Resources Working Group Page 3 of 5 Geographic Scope for HERC Fund (in priority order) • In the Basin • Immediately downstream (Middle Skagit) • Lower Skagit/estuary • Upstream/offsite Other Items • Money should be in an interest-bearing account • Funds will be tied to an index and there should be interest on unspent funds • Clarify language around matching funds • Clarify that BRCC members who are contracted to perform work aren’t included under the prohibitions 3.4.4: Habitat Restoration • USFS inundated lands in Upper Baker Upcoming RESOLVE Sessions 9/29/03—9:00 a.m.-3:00 p.m., PSE Bothell Office 10/16/03—9:00 a.m. – 3:00 p.m., PSE Bothell Office 10/27/03—9:00 a.m. – 3:00 p.m., USFS Mountlake Terrace Agenda for 9/29/03 Meeting • Review agenda, notes and action items • Review agreements from 9/19/03 meeting • 3.4.1 Fluvial Geomorphic Management • 3.2.3 Downstream Passage • 3.5.1-3 Water Quality & SPCC Plan • 3.3.1 Flow Regime • Agenda for next meeting PME Status Check: 3.1.1 HERC Fund Preliminary Tentative Agreement 3.1.2 Fish Propagation Tentative Agreement 3.2.1 Upstream Passage Tentative Agreement Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Aquatics Resources Working Group Page 4 of 5 3.2.2 Connectivity (Baker & Shannon) Preliminary Tentative Agreement 3.2.3 Downstream Passage 3.3.1 Flow Regime 3.4.1 Fluvial Management 3.4.2 Large Woody Debris Management Tentative Agreement 3.4.3 Erosion Management 3.4.4 Aquatic Habitat Restoration 3.5.1 Flow Release Water Quality 3.5.2 Reservoir Water Quality 3.5.3 SPCC Plan 6.3 Reservoir Level Management Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Aquatics Resources Working Group Page 5 of 5
