Baker River Project Relicense Final Meeting Notes February 25, 2014  FERC Project No. 2150 Page 1 of 3   REVIEW OF AGENDA AND MEETING NOTES The finalized meeting notes from our last meeting on October 15, 2013 have been posted to the PSE website at http://pse.com/aboutpse/HydroLicensing/Pages/Baker-River-Licensing.aspx. LEO REVIEW Communication: There is good cell phone reception at boat launches. WDFW lacks a Whatcom County-type radio to communicate with the County. They have some radio channels they use with the FS. Brian will follow up with Rich on this. Perhaps they could cover the cost of the service (~$30/month) and the FS could cover the purchase cost. Cell phone boosters are another option. Ray reported the boosters provide coverage for all but about 6 miles of the area, up to mile post 22- 23. We agreed to try the boosters and see how well they work before incurring the cost of a satellite phone. Increasing cell coverage is also important to officer safety. Patrol Hours: The Forest Service funded Whatcom. Co. 300 total hours in 2013 and will continue to fund the same number for the 2014 season. Note: The hourly rate for Whatcom Co. officers is now $73 (up from $65). Coverage is important on Fridays. Jeremy won't be there. Mason will be off Tuesday/Wednesday or Wednesday/Thursday and work the rest of the days. Ray will help work Friday and Saturday nights and Sunday evenings. He will be off Wednesday/Thursday. Mason will be in touch with Ray on scheduling (as he did with Jeremy). PSE funded Whatcom Co. 160 patrol hours in 2013 and will do the same for 2014. PSE will keep the hours for WDFW at 200 for 2014 (They worked 169 in 2013). PSE has agreed to 100 patrol hours for Skagit County Sheriff's Office. The Forest Service will support 250 hours and will do the same for WDFW and focus on weekend mornings and scatter throughout the week. Fishery: There will be a fishery on Skagit River June of this year. There wasn't one last year. WDFW anticipates a longer season in 2014 and about three times the number of fish. Last year we had $18K adult fish returns. Expect above the 50K mark. WDFW may increase the catch limit from 2 to 3 to help compensate. Need to get the real story out about what is happening with the fishery. Dedicated Coverage from Skagit County: Fred and Chris (Skagit County) have asked Pam to let them know when we need them to patrol around Lake Shannon. PSE has requested dedicated time on opening fishing weekend and also when doing tours. They have also been asking WDFW to help patrol around Lake Shannon. (There has been no presence there the last few years). This will set the tone of having a presence for the rest of the season. There was been problems with vandalism in the past. PSE has maintenance people doing lawn mowing, etc. There have been access issues through the quarry. Some people have been hanging out at the office area. While there is no overnight camping allowed at Lake Shannon, people are allowed to leave their vehicles there. PSE has agreed to up to and not to exceed 100 patrol hours.  Baker River Project Relicense LEP Final Meeting Notes February 25, 2014  FERC Project No. 2150 Page 2 of 3   EQUIPMENT FUNDED FOR 2014 SEASON Annual LEP FUND includes 95K / year, $73K of which is designated to the FS to distribute, and $22K is designated to PSE to distribute. We agree collaboratively on how these funds should be spent. We agreed to fund the following equipment for the 2014 recreational season: <b7> PSE will use a portion of LEP funds to purchase 3 trail cameras (blackout mode) @ $200 each and a python lock for each @ $20 each. WDFW will install these at strategic locations on PSE properties (not Forest Service property as the FS wants to study the issue more). <b7> The Forest Service will also fund Wilson cell phone boosters: o 1 for Whatcom County (with permanent antennae) @ $300. o 1 for WDFW (with permanent antennae) @ $300. o 1 for WDFW (portable) for use in boat on Baker Lake @ $275. <b7> PSE will fund Wilson cell phone booster for Skagit County (with permanent antennae) @ $300.
