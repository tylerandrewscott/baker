Meeting Notes – Baker River Basin Native Char Consultation Fish Passage Technical Working Group (FPTWG) Project:  Baker River Project FERC No. 2150  Written By:  Nathanael Overman, PSE  Meeting Date:  January, 19 2010 (Tue.), 9:00 am – 12:30 pm  Location:  USFWS Office, Lacey, WA  Attendees:  Doug Bruland, PSE Jeff Chan, USFWS Haley Edwards, PSE Cary Feldmann, PSE Denise Hawkins, USFWS  Purpose:  Review 2009 genetic analysis of tissue samples and discuss implications for a fishway between Lake Shannon and Baker Lake.  Phil Hilgert, R2 LouEllyn Jones, USFWS Nathanael Overman, PSE Maureen “Mo” Small, WDFW Nick Verretto, PSE  Generally following the agenda (attachment 1), the group reviewed a summary of char captures and handling in 2009, results of the WDFW genetic analysis of Baker basin char, and implications for fishway options to establish connectivity between Lake Shannon and Baker Lake. Phil opened the meeting by reviewing the 2009 Baker basin bull trout captures (Table 1) and discussing the results of the 2009 char snorkel surveys in the Baker River/tributaries (Table 2) and Sulphur Creek (Table 3). Lower counts in Sulphur Creek were thought to have resulted from new personnel conducting the survey rather than representing actual population changes. High numbers of woody debris in Sulphur Creek make char observations difficult and an effort will be made to help the survey crew incorporate more effective methods of observation such as the use of flashlights during future surveys. WDFW Genetic Analysis Summary Tissue samples from char captured in the Baker River basin were analyzed by WDFW to evaluate potential genetic differences. Mo discussed these results and explained the figures and tables included in the final report (12/10/09).  Methods Baker River Hydroelectric Project, FERC Nos.

Samples consisted of 297 adults or sub-adults and 176 juveniles collected throughout the Baker Basin at the following locations: the Upper Baker (UB) River and tributaries, UB FSC and Gulper, tailrace below UB dam, Sulphur Creek, Lower Baker Gulper, and the adult trap (Table 4). Bull trout were genotyped at 16 microsatellite DNA loci (standardized among labs researching bull trout) to identify their genetic origins. Of the 473 samples submitted for analysis, 418 had at least seven loci in their genotype which provided enough genetic data to analyze in the study (Table 4). Several statistical analyses were used to estimate the level of genetic distinction among individuals and populations. In the GeneClass analysis, relative likelihood values were calculated for each bull trout to estimate the likelihood that individuals originated in one of four baseline collections: Sulphur Creek, Upper Baker, Illabot Creek, and Sauk River. A likelihood value of 90% was used as a threshold for making positive genetic assignments to these baseline collections. In the STRUCTURE analysis, individual genotypes were partitioned into clusters of genetic similarity. By sorting fish into hypothetical clusters representing genetically unique populations, this allowed tests to be conducted to evaluate multiple distinct populations in the Baker Basin.  Results (summary bullets from WDFW report)  We found five brook trout that had been collected in the downstream fish passage facility (Lower Baker Gulper), and no interspecific hybrids.  Juvenile samples from Sulphur Creek and Upper Baker River represent separate populations and can be used as a Baker River Basin bull trout genetic baseline.  Based on analyses of juvenile, sub-adult and adult samples from the Upper Baker River and the adult trap in the Lower Baker River, there appears to be more than one bull trout population in the Upper Baker basin.  Adult bull trout collected at the Lower Baker River trap for transport into the Upper Baker reservoir come from within the Baker River basin and from outside the basin.  Most sub-adult fish collected in the Upper Baker downstream fish passage facility (Upper Baker Gulper and FSC) had ancestry in the Baker River basin and three had ancestry in the Sauk population.  Sauk-ancestry juvenile fish collected in the Upper Baker FSC indicate that Sauk fish transported in the trap and haul operation have reproduced in the Upper Baker basin.  The Baker River basin bull trout populations continue to express migratory behavior. Denise noted that the results indicate there are at least two Upper Baker bull trout populations. Additional populations in the Baker Lake watershed might be identified if additional tributaries are sampled; however, it was agreed that identifying additional Baker Lake bull trout populations would have little bearing on transport protocols. Fish from each Baker Lake population would sort themselves out upon transport and release into Baker Lake. Baker River Hydroelectric Project, FERC Nos.

It was noted that bull trout sampled in the Upper Baker River and its tributaries were almost exclusively of Upper Baker origin, and similarly, relatively few fish with origins outside of Sulphur Creek were captured in Sulphur Creek. Prior to 2009, approximately equal numbers of out-of-basin and in-basin bull trout were captured in the adult trap, hauled upstream, and released into Baker Lake. During 2009, bull trout captured in the adult trap were released back into the Skagit River and only bull trout entering the trap a second time were hauled upstream and released into Baker Lake. Tissue samples were analyzed from 13 bull trout captured in the adult trap in 2009 (through Aug 7). Genetic analysis indicated 8 were of Upper Baker origin, 2 of Sulphur Creek origin, 2 of Illabot Creek origin, and 1 of Sauk River origin. Four of these bull trout were recaptured: 2 of Upper Baker origin and 2 of Sulphur Creek origin. Phil suggested that continuing the 2009 adult trap protocol through 2010 was needed to evaluate the success of using repeat captures to separate out-of-basin from in-basin fish. The group discussed the goals of establishing connectivity between Lake Shannon and Baker Lake. Jeff mentioned that the goals have evolved somewhat as more has been learned about Baker bull trout, and emphasized that the current goal for establishing connectivity should primarily be to get the majority of Baker Lake bull trout found in other areas back into Baker Lake to preserve their reproductive potential. It was noted that Upper Baker bull trout may be rearing in Lake Shannon but not reproducing. The group discussed the implications of the genetic results for the type of fishway that would meet the goal of returning Baker Lake fish back into Baker Lake. Specifically, the pros and cons of constructing a weir on Sulphur Creek, constructing a fish trap located near the base of Upper Baker Dam, and angling for bull trout were discussed. It was noted that a weir on Sulphur Creek would be highly effective at capturing bull trout, but Sulphur Creek fish would be exposed to handling stress if tissue samples were taken from every fish and then fish were held for 24 hours while genetic analysis was being conducted. It was further noted that the Sulphur Creek population appears to be relatively healthy; a weir could inhibit natural migratory movements and have unforeseen adverse effects on the Sulphur Creek population. Conversely, a fish trap at the base of Upper Baker Dam would likely catch a higher percentage of fish of Upper Baker origin, but the effectiveness of a trap for capturing adult bull trout would likely be low. A third option, angling for bull trout, was discussed. Angling could be more productive than a trap for capturing fish, and could cover spring, summer and fall periods. Adult bull trout can be easily captured by angling at the Lake Shannon gulper, but Phil suggested that angling in the late summer and fall near the Upper Baker tailrace would more likely capture bull trout of Upper Baker origin exhibiting upstream migratory behavior. Jeff commented that an appropriate short-term solution for a fishway might be to actively collect and transport bull trout (e.g., via angling), whereas long-term, relying on PIT-tagging all bull trout encountered at the fish passage facilities may be sufficient. Regardless of the type of fishway, Denise and Mo indicated that segregating Baker Lake, Lake Shannon, and out-of-basin bull trout populations would be beneficial.

A follow-up meeting was scheduled for February 26 from 9-11 am in Lacey. Tentative Agenda Items 1) Confirm handling protocols for 2010. During 2009, all bull trout encountered at the PSE Baker fish passage facilities were PIT-tagged and genetic samples collected and analyzed. Bull trout captured in the adult trap were released back into the Skagit River and only bull trout entering the adult trap a second time were hauled upstream and released into Baker Lake. Tentative recommendation is to continue these protocols through 2010. 2) Confirm PSE's response to Article 104: Connectivity. Tentative recommendation is to angle for bull trout in Lake Shannon and transport and release Baker Lake origin fish back into Baker Lake. If angling is confirmed as the approach for 2010, the level of effort and other details will need to be worked out 3) Jeff mentioned that Jon-Paul Shannahan was interested in sampling bull trout for diet analysis, and suggested that this be discussed at the next meeting.
