All – Review Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington: http://www.ecy.wa.gov/biblio/0406025.html. Consider if this is what we want to use this as a pre- acquisition survey. All – Review Methods of Assessing Wetland Functions – Riverine and Depressional Wetlands in the Lowlands of Western Washington: http://www.ecy.wa.gov/biblio/99115.html. Consider if this is a more detailed assessment we may want to use. Keep in mind what would help us with a Habitat Assessment Implementation Plan. Lauri – Run proposed relevant TRMP language by Washington Heritage Program rep. Lauri – Get damage complaint information/maps (showing distance between areas of potential animal damage conflict) from Regional Office. SKAGIT COUNTY UPDATE Tony and Cary updated the group about the shoreline exemption application PSE has submitted to Skagit County. It was denied, overturned, and is now in appeal before the Skagit County Commissioners. If the loon and osprey nests are pulled out of Skagit County, the shoreline permit will not be necessary. The plan is to install loon platforms during the first quarter of 2007, and PSE is looking into alternate sites in case the appeals process drags out too long. BRICC UPDATE Nothing new here. FERC is still telling us that the DEIS will be out sometime in November. Stay tuned. LAND ACQUISITION UPDATE Mike Mueller (RMEF) and the owner of the property met two weeks ago; the owner gave Mike a tour of the property. He indicated that he is not interested in selling; he wants to leave a legacy to his heirs. Mike shared with him several options other than sale of the property (easements, etc), and the owner was open to those options. Mike will be in touch with him again before Thanksgiving. Tony will keep us informed of progress along the way. TRMP REVIEW Marty led us through a review of the October 3 draft of the Terrestrial Resource Management Plan. Jamie made real-time edits to capture feedback from TRIG members.
