The meeting starts at 9 a.m. to ~1 p.m. We will have three decisions on the agenda, so please designate a Proxy to express your view if you cannot attend! Decision (1): This is a proposal relative to Article 101 Fish Propagation, to extend the deadline to complete the final report for the Sockeye Smolt Production Capacity study to November 15, 2010. See the proposed revised schedule to the ARG below: Sockeye Smolt Production Capacity, Article 101 (c)1 "We have been working with R2 in response to Settlement Agreement Article 101(c)1, a study evaluating the potential number of sockeye smolts that could rear in Baker Lake and Lake Shannon. The article called for “a study completed no later than two years following license issuance”. Our schedule proposed to complete the study on or before October 1, 2010. R2 has been working very hard to complete the data analysis and reporting and can provide the basic results of the study on schedule. However, they have informed us there are some difficulties reproducing some of the results from Mazumder's 2004 study. An extension of the completion date would allow R2 to recalculate the models presented by Mazumder and provide additional information that would help interpretation of results. We agree that it would be beneficial to all parties if R2 could work through the additional analysis and expand the discussion section of the report. We are proposing an extension of the study completion date to November 15, 2010. R2 could present preliminary results at the September 14, 2010 ARG meeting. The ARG would receive the draft report by October 1, 2010 and the ARG would be provided with appropriate time for review (30 days). The proposed schedule is: • Draft report submitted to ARG: October 1, 2010 • ARG 30-day review: October 1 – October 31, 2010 • Discuss results at ARG conference call October 12 • Respond to ARG Comments: November 1 – November 14, 2010 1 • Report Complete: November 15, 2010 The proposed schedule change will be presented for a decision by the ARG at the next meeting on September 14th." Decision (2): This is a proposal relative to Article 108 Gravel, to submit an alternative schedule to FERC for approval, to extend the deadline to file with FERC a Baker River Gravel Management Plan (BRGMP) to January 31, 2011. See the proposed revised schedule to the ARG below: • Draft BRGMP submitted to ARG: September 16, 2010 • ARG 60-day review per Article 108: September 16 – November 15, 2010 • Respond to ARG Comments, Additional Consultation if Necessary, Submit BRGMP to FERC November 15 – January 31, 2011 The proposed schedule change will be presented for a decision by the ARG at the next meeting on September 14th. Decision (3): This is a proposal relative to Article 109 Large Woody Debris (SA109), to submit an alternative schedule to FERC for approval, to extend the deadline to file with FERC a Large Woody Debris Management Plan (LWDMP) to January 31, 2011. See the proposed revised schedule to the ARG below: • Draft LWDMP submitted to ARG: September 22, 2010 • ARG 60-day review per Article 109: September 22 – November 21, 2010 • Respond to ARG Comments, Additional Consultation if Necessary, Submit BRGMP to FERC November 15 – January 31, 2011 The proposed schedule change will be presented for a decision by the ARG at the next meeting on September 14th. A tentative draft agenda is attached, which includes the decisions needed, followed by updates from the sockeye smolt capacity study, the Fish Passage Technical Working Group, the spawning beach renovation, spawning beach decommissioning proposal and other recent implementation activities. If you have additional topics to add to the agenda, please let me know. Thanks. 1 Draft ARG Agenda 9 14 10.doc.
