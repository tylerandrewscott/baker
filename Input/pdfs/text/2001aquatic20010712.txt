Baker River Project Relicense Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 071201 minutes; Lyn Wiltse  2 of 6   <b7> Nick: Set up a conference call to get direction on level of survey (Type A/B) for A-1a.  STUDY REQUEST SUBMITTALS/STUDY PLAN DEVELOPMENT  Study #  Title  Notes/Next Steps  A01.A Reservoir Tributary Habitat Surveys Team members participated in a June 26, 2001  conference call to discuss this survey. Nick will  distribute notes from this call by July 11.  During the call they revised the study plan and  Phil distributed the updated version. He  attached a copy of the base map and tables of  detailed habitat surveys, outlining which  surveys were Type A/B coverage. We are now  moving to implementation. If anyone has any  concerns, let Sue/Phil know ASAP, as they are  putting together the study schedule for August.  Brady brought up the issue of limited Forest  Service funds available. R-2 will contact the  Park Service to see if they can assist with the  survey.  A01.B Reservoir Tributary Biological Surveys We are trying to inventory available data  before going out and re-surveying streams.  Phil distributed a one-page summary of  spawning survey data derived from raw data  provided by Stan. Phil is trying to figure out  which streams have two years of continuous  survey coverage. There are still additional data  to insert into these tables. The next step will be  to identify gaps in the existing data and  recommend surveys accordingly.  A01.C Reservoir Tributary Delta Surveys  The study design was distributed prior to the  last meeting. They are moving to  implementation. The field work is slated to  begin in September. Any additional comments,  please let Phil/Sue know ASAP  A02 LB River Habitat Mapping  We are moving to implementation. This will  be done in September, 2001 and Spring, 2002.  A03 Reservoir Fish Population  R-2 is still awaiting data for reservoir fish  Characteristics  population. Karen will prod Gary for data.  A04 LB/Skagit River Flow, Gaging  Ongoing  A05 Water Quality Sampling  Nick is still drafting this request. He will  coordinate with Ecology, then USFS.  A06 UB Passage Design Baffle Modification Ongoing. There will be a Fish Passage  A08 UB Passage System Evaluation  Technical Design Team meeting August 1st.  The results of the study will be presented at our  August 9th, meeting.

A19 Review Limnological Information A20 Large Woody Debris Management  This will be conducted July 17th and 1th8. We are working on getting bottom contour. Phil is working on a Baker flow management model (based on 80 years of flow data), with the intent to protect redds with acceptable (undefined at this point) impact to project operations. He is looking at what volume of water is needed at 2/3 of the spawning flow (10 day rolling average during the spawning period.) He distributed an example graph for discussion. This is not a PSE proposal. We are looking at scheduling a Technical Working Group to address this critical issue before this fall. Possible dates July 26 m(a.m.), 27, 30, August 2, 3 or the next working group mtg. Of Aug. 9. Nick will be setting up this meeting. Chuck went out on June 15,2001, to get full pool data. We'll get his report at our September meeting. Parking Lot - not for 2001. Split between A09 and A21. Still being fleshed out (keep separate from A05). Not for 2001 - Needs further development. Phil suggested that rather than measure scour and fill in distributary channels (as Stan originally suggested), we try to draw a more direct correlation between scour, fill and redds. R-2 will send out a revised study plan to reflect this broader scope. The Forest Service likes this expanded scale of the study. We would be looking at the area (riverine, delta, lakeshore) use, current and pre-project populations, and associated risks with each. R-2 will send out a revised Study Plan and get with Stan separately prior to our next meeting. Pending <ad> Not for 2001. Still pending. Merged into A-01 Pending with A13 The Study Plan is in progress. If anyone is aware of any permitting process for large woody debris removal in the Baker  Baker River Project Relicense Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 071201 minutes; Lyn Wiltse  4 of 6   A21 Skagit Wild & Scenic River Values A22 Baker Lake Trout Impacts Evaluation A23 Baker River Wild & Scenic River Values A24 Hydrologic and Geomorphic Analysis  Development let Arnie or Phil know ASAP. Does anyone know anything about ownership documents indicating who owns the wood? Partly being addressed in A09 and A24. This is still in progress. On June 20, Brady provided R-2 with a map of USFS ownership along the Skagit River below Baker Lake. The aim is to AD mark the Rainbow Trout planted in Depression and Baker Lakes to see if trout are over wintering and also see what they are eating. Do they survive long enough to contribute to the fishery? The marking has already been done. This request is still pending. It may not be necessary if PSE re-directs planting to Depression Lake only. Consensus of the group was that this might be a good idea. At this point, Puget has been directed by the State to increase stocking at Baker Lake and reduce stocking at Depression Lake. Trout Unlimited would like to see these studies moving forward with potential to identify interaction of species (non-native to native) and potential for brood stocking in the future (instead of the current Heinz 57 variety.) We will send this study to the Recreation Working Group for review. What would be the recreation impact of moving all stocking to Depression Lake? Defer to August 9 meeting. Moving to implementation. Looking at December 2001. (Folds into A09).
