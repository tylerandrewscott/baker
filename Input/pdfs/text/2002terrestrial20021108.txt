"Championing" Drafts 6. Next Steps 7. Adjourn  NEW ACTION ITEMS   Marty: Re-write PME 109 Marty: Draft a salmonid PME All: Review interests of their stakeholder group/organization. Marty: Check w/Connie re: USFWS interests. Tony: Call Ann and Laurel about taking lead on rare plant and noxious weed PMEs Marty: Consider a PME proposal for little Baker River and run by Stan, Tony, and Gene (and Arn Thoreen). Marty: Re-write action in PME 103 using the goat PME information that Don developed, and send to Don for review. Marty: Write up undesirable wildlife PME (Team Leader Note: Marty will make recommended edits listed below to the PME sheets and forward updated sheets to respective team leaders. Once they have approved them, Marty will provide a full updated set to working group members).  PME TOPICS LIST  Marty reviewed how he organized and drafted this first cut of PMEs. We discussed how the matrix needs to be updated to complete it. We also discussed the number system and format and agreed on several changes to the format. The "Justification" heading will be changed to "Rational", and we agreed that within this section we can note agreement/disagreement with project nexus, if we want to (we will try is an see if it works). We also changed the heading of "Advantages" to "Benefits', and "Disadvantages" to "Considerations".  REVIEW OF FIRST DRAFT SUMMARY SHEETS  Review of 101  We agreed that in the title of actions there should be no statements of justification, so should read "Manage Lands within the current Project Boundary"  Lead: Tony Teamlet: Lauri, Don Participant Priority: leave all blank at this time.  Description of Proposed Actions: <b7> For all actions, replace "justification" with "Rationale", "Advantages" with "Benefits", and "Disadvantages" with "Considerations." <b7> Add actions for "Artificial cavity nest structures" (101-H?), and for "Riparian Hardwood Forest enhancement" (101-I?) (Marty writes?)  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 7/30/2002 FINAL MEETING NOTES M. Vaughn for Terrestrial PM&E Teamlet FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 2 of 5   <b7> Rationale for 101-A to include "Water level fluctuations w/in drawdown zone can have direct effects on wildlife, including use of habitat." <b7> Rationale for 101-B to include "State-listed species (Sensitive), reservoir fluctuations preclude loon nesting. <b7> Rationale for 101-C to include "Lake Shannon reservoir fluctuation can affect osprey nesting success. Old natural osprey nesting sites are falling down. <b7> Rationale for 101-D to include "Opportunities to manage/enhance forage are to benefit species. There are seasonal forage needs that are/may be limited in the basin." Add at the end of the Description "...and other species". <b7> For 101-E, change "kill trees" to "Create/develop snags", or "Implement snag management program". Rational to include "The area around Lake Shannon is suspected to have limited snag habitat." <b7> For 101-F, change Description to "Create or enhance wetlands through modifying topography..." Rationale to include "Wetlands are valuable habitat and are of interest to many stakeholders, and are of limited number in the basin. This action may help control non-native species, and improve amphibian habitat. <b7> For 101-G, modify Description to say "...multi-storied coniferous forest...." (may be a question about interest in this action). <b7> For the new 101-H, rationale should include "birds make cavities in Lake Shannon snags that get flooded out. Creation of safe nesting structures would be helpful in the interim while snags are being developed (101-E)." This entire action could be combined with 101-E. <b7> For new 101-I, rationale should include "riparian hardwood forest is limited in amount and distribution in the Basin. May have limited habitat connectivity. Review of 102 Title: Should read "Manage lands for wildlife outside the existing Project boundary." Lead: Lauri Teamlet: Don, Lauri, Bob, Stan, Tony, Bob Kuntz (?), Patrick (?). From matrix, add "out of kind" (T2-8), "out of basin, in kind (T4 -?), and add T7-3 to 102-C. Review of 103 Lead: Tony Teamlet: Don, Russ (?), Tony, Bob N. Actions: <b7> 103-C: Add "public lands" to description. <b7> 103-H: (T8-4) <b7> Should modify the action specific to goals with the Goat PME information that Don prepared. Marty will re-write this action and send to Don for review.  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 7/30/2002 FINAL MEETING NOTES M.

Teamlet: Ann, Laurel Review of 108 Lead: Don Teamlet: Don and Lauri Review of 109 Keep title but don't pursue at this time.

Add actions under this PME: <b7> 110-B: Little Baker River <b7> 110-C: Lower Baker River Delta  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 7/30/2002 FINAL MEETING NOTES M. Vaughn for Terrestrial PM&E Teamlet FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 4 of 5   Review of 111 Hold as a placeholder. Tony is point person for the working group. Add PME 112: Nutritional Enhancement This PME is dealing with nutritional enhancements, specifically with food sources and available nutrients (related to matrix number T7-4). These could be added as actions under PMEs 101 and 102 if we wanted to organize them that way. Actions could include: <b7> Nutritional enhancement program (elk, bears (?), etc.) <b7> Passage of Salmonids <b7> Salmonid carcasses Lead: Don Teamlet: Don, Gene, Tony Add PME 113: Undesirable Wildlife Hold as placeholder. Tony is point person for the working group. Other Matrix/PME Summary Sheet Changes <b7> Drop T2-1, T2-9, and T2-10 (on legislative issues, Patrick will prepare something for Solution Team). <b7> Re-number T2 list on Matrix HANDOUTS <b7> Baker River Project: PME Action Item Table. <b7> PME/Action Item Conversion Table Crosswalk. <b7> Draft Proposed Terrestrial Resources PME Summary Sheets <b7> Suggestions for review of the first draft of the Terrestrial Resources PME Summary Sheets MEETING EVALUATION There was no formal evaluation.
