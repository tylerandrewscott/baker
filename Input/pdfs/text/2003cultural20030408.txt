Evaluate Meeting NEW ACTION ITEMS • Kelly: Send Jessie ethnographic table of contents to distribute for all to review. • ALL: Let Lyn know if you are interested in joining the HYDROPS teamlet (the “Technical Scenarios Teamlet” or TST).

BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 4-08-03 MEETING Page 2 Cultural and Historic Resources Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150   •  • • • • • •  • • •  Jessie: Will schedule HYDROPS demonstration at a future meeting. We learned that the model is expected to be complete (include the modifications requested by the USFS) by April 15. Paul Wetherbee is putting together a teamlet to develop a process to handle requests for HYDROPS runs across all working groups. They will develop naming conventions and standardized input/output formats. Kelly: Checked in with Jason re: status of UDP. They updated the list of contacts. Lyn: Resolved schedule for November working group meeting dates. Our November meeting date will be the 18th. Chris: Developed an initial draft HPMP outline for review at this meeting. ALL: Gave Jessie feedback on Bruce’s list of key conflicts, key synergies and shared interests/concerns by February 24. Bruce: Emailed Connie above handout with revisions noted from Cultural Working Group, Aquatic Working Group and Economic/Operations Working Group by February 14. Ardis: Checked ORV access on Basin trails on Forest Service lands. Ardis reported that even if a road is gated, it is not officially “closed” unless backed up by a CFR. Only then is the closure enforceable. If we, as a working group, have a concern we need to call out specific roads where we want to designate a closure or a change in use. Lyn: Saw that team leaders sent out updated version of Bruce’s handout to all to review by month end. ALL: Let Jessie know your feedback on our proposed APE, as we hope to complete field work by the end of February. ALL: Reviewed erosion study and gave Jessie feedback by the end of February.  ARCHAEOLOGY STUDY Chris reported the survey was finished (they have evaluated all the sites that were accessible given the reservoir levels) on March 31. They have submitted site descriptions and preliminary evaluations for initial review. They expect to have the report complete on April 25. FERC RELICENSING TIMELINE FOR CULTURAL TASKS Jessie distributed the following update to the schedule: Proposed Actions • 2nd Draft Proposed Actions are due May 1, 2003. • 2nd Draft Proposed Actions will be out for review by May 7, 2003 • Cross Resource Workshop will be on May 14, 2003 (8:00-5:00 at the Embassy Suites in Lynnwood) • Complete revisions are due June 1, 2003 Historic Properties Management Plan (HPMP) • Preliminary Draft HPMP is due May 1, 2003 • Draft HPMP is due September 30, 2003 (2nd Draft License Application) • Final HPMP will be due March 31, 2004  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 4-08-03 MEETING Cultural and Historic Resources Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 3   PDEA STATUS RE: CULTURAL RESOURCES Pat Weslowski from the Louis Berger Group is putting together the cultural/historical portion of the PDEA. They are concentrating on the affected environment. Kelly put together an ethnographic table of contents for them to use. We have shared with Pat the sites we know about. Concern was expressed that the information around sites be treated with proper disclosure/non-disclosure in the PDEA. We agreed that Jessie, Kelly and Chris should review the preliminary draft of the PDEA for cultural sensitivity before it’s released for broader review. TRADITIONAL CULTURAL PROPERTIES (TCPs) Kelly reported that these discussions with the tribes are proceeding. They are discussing short-term and long-term plans. They are also beginning to define tribal representation for these. Kelly is making sure they are comfortable with the ethnography. Chris and Kelly are planning to do a presentation on archaeology and TCPs at tribal locations in early May. HISTORIC PROPERTIES MANAGEMENT PLAN (formerly known as CRMP) We reviewed the draft outline of the HPMP put together by Chris Miss. Several changes were suggested and incorporated into the outline. Chris will send to Jessie the edited version of the outline so she can distribute it to working group members. Working Group members will get additional feedback back to Jessie by April 25. UDP STATUS This plan is being followed currently. PMES/MARCH WORKSHOP We considered walking through the initial draft actions that were reviewed at the March Cross Resource Workshop. Jessie mentioned that she had been approached by someone asking for feedback on Recreation Working group intentions to build a campground on Lake Shannon. Working group members were pleased that they recognized the need to check in, up front, with us to see if there are cultural sensitivities associated with the land where the disturbance was planned. This request prompted a discussion about how we should handle such requests. It was suggested that we start by asking whether it is inside out APE. If so, the request would be reviewed by a teamlet of this working group. That teamlet (Jessie, Chris, Kelly, Jan) would determine how to respond to the request. Their response would include getting feedback from the tribes. Their response would either be to go ahead, or that there are cultural issues associated with the request and that the initiator would have to spend additional time and/or money addressing these issues. The proposed action might have to be redesigned many times before a NEPA document could be issued, and so forth. If the request concerned land outside the APE, a study would be commissioned to survey for cultural resources. Jan and Ardis will discuss this procedure with Rod Mace and we will resume this discussion at our May meeting. Larry noted that the intent is not to halt the execution of any proposed action, but to work with the initiators to see how best to do it so as to preserve the resource. BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 4-08-03 MEETING Cultural and Historic Resources Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 4   Proposed format for “second draft proposed actions” 1. HPMP • Include outline as is plus expanded version of Section 6 on implementation. 2. Set up funding group to deal with concerns re: mudding in the draw down zone, etc. 3. Provide law enforcement program complete with training of local law enforcement and agencies. EROSION CONTROL STUDY Jessie distributed CDs of the A14A Reservoir Shoreline Erosion and Deposition Report. Photos are included on the CDs. The Aquatics contractor would like feedback on this by April 25. Please review this to check for data gaps. They have mapped erosion zones, and described different types of erosion and deposition events. Please let Jessie know if you have feedback or questions for the contractor. HISTORIC RESOURCES DRAFT REPORT Jessie distributed copies of the initial draft of this report. The contractors divided their findings into three general historic themes: • Lower Baker Hydro Electric Project (facility and associated buildings) • Baker River fisheries historic districts (lots of information from salmon history very innovative). Includes relict features • WA Portland Cement District – Storage silos and some associated structures. They didn’t feel the Upper Baker project had historic eligibility. All were asked to review this draft report and be ready to give the contractors feedback at out May meeting at the Lodge (10:00-noon). We should also consider the information in this report from the perspective of management plans.
