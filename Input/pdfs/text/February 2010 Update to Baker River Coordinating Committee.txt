Below an update of the past month's Baker Resource Group activities. Our next Face-to-face meeting will be April 28 at the Snoqualmie Operations Center .We may slip that meeting to May because the ARG will be holding an in-person meeting in April and back to back meetings with travel may not be efficient. I will send notices, directions and other information as the date approaches. We will continue to reserve the 4th Wednesday each month for a conference call or face to face meeting in case. Thanks, Cary February Update to BRCC: TRIG: The TRIG met via conference call and WebEx on February 4th. PSE reported that annual financial report summary that will be coming out the end of March. The report will include remaining acquisition funds and will show expenditures against the capped budgets. The newly acquired piece of property we are calling the Alder Creek property just had the road easement from the DNR finalized, and once the document is signed Ira McDaniel will then finish the payments for the easement. We discussed other alternative properties, with the WDFW stating that they could not support acquisition of one parcel, but could support purchasing several other suggested pieces. An Elk Teamlet will be meeting on February 24th to start the process of developing a management program for the Alder Creek property. Two bald eagle night roost surveys were performed in January, with eagles seen but no night roost identified so far. Two additional no-wake buoys will be placed near the Baker Lake loon platforms, and the Lake Shannon platform will be installed soon (with potentially a new platform design). The Botanical Teamlet met on February 3rd and went over plans for conduction work in 2010, including mapping and planning for reed canarygrass control in the 7 wetland areas, noxious weed treatments, and planning for revegetation work. A field visit to two tansy ragwort sites on Baker Lake was conducted with no plants observed, so there will be a file:///C|/.../LOCALS~1/Temp/A9R289B.tmp/February%202010%20Update%20to%20Baker%20River%20Coordinating%20Committee.htm[1/6/2011 10:19:32 AM] follow-up survey later in the spring. The next scheduled TRIG meeting will be face to face (with conference call and WebEx for those that can't attend) on April 1st (no joke), so we are skipping a month. An Aquatic Riparian Habitat Working Group meeting will take place instead of the TRIG meeting in March. CRAG: "The CRAG's regularly scheduled meeting was canceled and field trip to discuss a stabilization project with Forest Service, PSE, and tribal personnel was completed instead. Several options for the project were discussed. A schedule for the project is under development, but work is not likely to occur until late winter/early spring 2011. The CRAG will have an HPMP technical meeting on March 3 or 8th and a field trip to discuss the LB FSC has been tentatively scheduled for March 17th." ARG: The ARG met at PSE's Skagit Service Center on February 9th. PSE provided the latest updates on the fish passage articles, including progress on the Adult Fish Trap construction (SA103) which is proceeding well to a June 1 start-up, a presentation on connectivity-native char investigations (SA104), updates to Upper Baker FSC performance study planning and Lower Baker FSC design development (SA105). PSE will be submitting the upstream fish trap preliminary emergency response plan and O&M plan shortly to the ARG for "30-day" review, per article (103) and also annual operations reports for the fish passage articles (103-105). The Fish Passage Technical Working Group will met on February 19th and there will be another six meetings this year to address Lower Baker FSC design stages with 100% design projected for January 2011. PSE also presented pictures of the recent hatchery construction progress (it is on schedule). Office functions have been transferred to the hatchery building, the head tank & sand separator will be used for water supply next month and the outside rearing tanks and raceways are being constructed. R2 Resource Consultants provided a mid-study progress presentation on the Sockeye Productivity Study (SA101c). A final report will be presented at the September ARG meeting. PSE reported that it is continuing negotiations to engage Tetra Tech on analyses of critical flood events (SA107c). At the ARG meeting, three items were distributed relative to SA505: 1) Revised Draft ARP, 2) Consultation Summary), and 3) Topics for Further Discussion (items identified for further clarification). The intent was to distribute these documents, introduce the discussion topics, and initiate discussions in advance of an ARHWG meeting scheduled for March 4th, where they will work through each of these in detail. The next ARG meeting is scheduled as a conference call/web-ex on March 9, 2010 at 9:00 a.m and should include the usual topic reports. Conference calls and in-person meetings will alternate each month throughout 2010. The next in- person meeting, on April 13, is reserved at PSE's Snoqualmie Operations Center. RRG: Recreation Resources Group meeting was held on February 16. The Law Enforcement Planning team (teamlet of the RRG) was held following the RRG meeting. Next RRG meeting will be held on April 20. The meeting location is to be determined and depending upon need, may be a conference call and web-ex meeting.
