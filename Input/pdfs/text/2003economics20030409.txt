Gave feedback to Dave. <b7> Dave: Got with Mark K., Ken, and others to work on study plan for R02. <b7> Keith: Issued on February 19th FERC's interpretation of the legal interpretation (preliminary analysis) on flood control, and how FERC would respond if the settlement agreement included a request to change the existing amount of flood storage [e.g. through Flood Control Act or amount in addition to Congressional authorization]. Also commented on which Acts trump FCA, etc. <b7> Lloyd: Sent Keith distribution list of working group participants so he could send out his paper on Feb. 19. <b7> Lyn: Added estimated time frames to March agenda. PME STATUS 5.01 <ad> CZMA Consistency This is a checklist of what needs to be accomplished for the license. (It is not moving forward as a study or PME.) 5.02 Additional Flows Jerry reported that EES met with the City of Anacortes and Skagit County PUD to discuss how this problem (domestic water supply) might be addressed. They hope to take their proposed solution (in the form of a MOA) to Ecology with the hope that DOE would sign it and administer it. Jerry will keep us posted. (The PME is not moving forward at this time until some other issues are resolved, such as working toward resolution through a MOA with DOE, and awaiting the results of the R2 instream flow study for fisheries resources.) JL It was clarified that minimum instream flows (MIFs) are based on the Mount Vernon gage and releases for domestic water supply are requested to be in addition to MIFs. MK 5.03 Submerged Lands For the FERC license, PSE has to control (own or have easement for lands within the FERC boundary.) Currently, PSE's control of submerged lands is 99% documented. There are a few small areas of question. DNR claims all lands beneath navigable waterways. PSE hopes to resolve this issue directly with DNR. 5.06 Flood Control The USACE proposed a study plan to examine this issue. Skagit County disagreed about the scope. Skagit County and the Corps mutually agreed at the Executive Committee to initiate a The County initiatedDB a 30-day technical study to identify potential benefits from additional flood control. Dave reported that this reconnaissance level study is now complete. Lloyd will send out copies of the study to members. Skagit County is inviting representatives from the USACE and PSE to walk through the findings of this study on April 15. They will then review this study also with the executive committee May 1 and determine the next steps. PSE expressed concern that folding an additional flood control study with its aquatic resource impacts into the re-licensing process might cause delays. They feel that Baker flood control is a Corps issue.  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 2150 4/09/2003 MEETING NOTES L Wiltse for Economics/Operations Working Group.  Page 3   Keith said we could put a placeholder in the license (as a specific license re-opener) for the planning of storage after study or USACE process complete. For purposes of the EA it would be sufficient to look at flood control options between 74 KAF and 100 KAFMK. Skagit County's interest is to see that the issue of public health and safety is given adequate consideration have this study done as soon as possibleDB and would like to see it folded into the re-licensing process. Ken Brettmann suggested that the Corp's proposal to use existing license article language, stating "...up to 100K acre feet is good as it allows for flexibility as to the optimal level of flood storage." If, at the May 2nd Skagit Flood Executive Committee Meeting, it is determined that more detailed study is warranted, he is doubtful that the Corps could come up with anything substantive by July, 2003 for inclusion in the PDEA (if it stays within the Corp's process.) TECHNICAL SCENARIOS TEAMLET AND REVIEW OF HYDROPS OUTPUTS Paul walked us through the draft paper he put together describing the integration of hydropower operations and habitat assessment models. There are two models: HYDROPS and R2's Habitat Analysis Model. These models will be working together to produce simulation results. HYDROPS runs with a set of operational conditions imposed (can be posed as hard or soft constraints) on it. R2's model considers potential environmental effects associated with simulated Project operations. Additional post processing of output data may occur in ExcelMK. Note: NaturalMK unregulated flows are used as basic inputs from the Baker River. Paul will be heading up a newly formed group: the Technical Scenarios Teamlet (TST). The role of this teamlet will include technical definitions, defining scenarios, tracking runs, QA, QC, and defining I/O formats. Their first meeting (by conference call) will be today at 1:00. Jerry, Dave, Bob, and Chuck indicated interest in attending the first meeting of the TST and possibly joining the group. Paul projected sample model output charts and asked for feedback. A standardized output package will be one of the early deliverables of the TST. ECONOMIC CRITERIA We reviewed the Draft Economic Considerations in evaluating PME costs that Mark put together last November. These include costsMK moneyMK (e.g., studies, future capital expenses, O&M, construction, etc.), megawatts of dependable capacity, and reduction in benefits and increased costs associated with shifting energy from peak windows to off-peak windows. This list was developed based on to supportMK the Developmental Analysis portion of the PDEA. The PDEA will show the incremental costs and benefits of each alternative. PROJECT DEPENDABILITY DROUGHT PME CAPACITY Mark shared with us information about something that is resulting in our coming up with an additional PME for analysis for Baker Project operations under drought conditionsMK. The Pacific Northwest Coordination Agreement was signed in 1964 by USACE, BPA and many NW utilities (including PSE) and renewed in 1997. The agreement formed an important component of regional plans to maximize optimizeMK hydro capability. The terms of this agreement extend through 2024.  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 2150 4/09/2003 MEETING NOTES L Wiltse for Economics/Operations Working Group.  Page 4   Agreement stipulates that parties agree to coordinate the operations of their respective systems to make available to each systems its optimum Firm Energy Load Carrying Capacity, provide FELCC for the coordinated systems, improve regional power production as a whole, annual planning period, set refill requirements for whole reservoir systems, guidance on shifting and shaping FLCC, reliability standards, integration of resources incl. maintenance, coordinate outages, and improve flexibility. Critical period refers to the portion of historical stream flow record, which, when combined with the drafting of all storage reservoirs from full to empty, would produce the least amount of energy shaped to seasonal load patterns. PSE's role: As one of the signatories of the agreement, PSE sends to the Power Pool outage forecasts and capacity estimates each winter. PSE's dependable capacity at Baker is affected by Corps-BPAMK agreement for Replacement Power for Upper Baker Flood ControlMK (1750 MWh per month for November through February and not to exceed 7 MW per hour) MK. We are talking with the Powel Group about taking this Dependable Capacity PME into consideration. Call 1-800-622-4520 to request copy of document: Power System Coordination: "A Guide to the Pacific Northwest Coordination Agreement." This document explains in great detail how the hydro systems in the Northwest are integrated under PNCAMK.
