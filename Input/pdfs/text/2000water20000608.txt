We added location and time under tentative agenda for next meeting.  INTRODUCTIONS The team welcomed Polly Fischer, homeowner and member of the Puget Sound Anglers. They also welcomed Jon Vanderheyden from the USDA- Forest Service.  FINAL TEAM MISSION STATEMENT The team revised the draft mission statement to read as follows:  "To identify issues and develop recommendations that provide for the protection and management of water quality, watershed processes, and hydrologic regimes associated with the Baker River Project that address the social, economic, terrestrial, and aquatic values they affect."  The team will review/revise this statement at the start of the next meeting.  WHO ELSE SHOULD BE INVOLVED? In order for the team to successfully accomplish its mission, it was suggested that the following entities participate:  USGS (as a resource) Natural Resource Conservation Service Skagit Fisheries Enhancement Group Town of Concrete Dept. of Natural Resources (Aquatic) Corps of Engineers NMFS Seattle City Light USFWS County (including beneficiaries of flood protection)  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 2   American Rivers  ACTION ITEMS Bob talked with Wayne Wagner (Corps). Wayne doesn't see the Corps taking an active role in this process because they are sticking with the existing license language (article 32) as it pertains to flood control. They will be a resource for the team.  Gary paraphrased an ecology sample goal statement as an FYI for the team: "To develop an agreement that addresses relicensing of the Baker River Hydroelectric Project consistent with the agencies' legislative mandates, policies, and applicable laws and the interests of all parties."  Bob B. Distributed the whole License Agreement for the Baker Project, along with two supplemental agreements: 1) The Corps flood control agreement (starts about half way back) 2) Operation of Spawning Beaches (WDFW)  MEETING NORMS The team revised the norms for the team. Changes are bolded. They will continue to revise this list over time so it suits the needs of the team:  1. Meetings will start and end on time. (Exceptions will be made as agreed to by team.) 2. Meet the morning of the second Thursday of the month from 9:30 to 12:30. (next two meetings are June 8 and July 13.) [Delete specific meeting dates] 3. About a 10 minute break half way through. 4. PSE will bring treats (morning: fruit and pastries and coffee; afternoons: cookies, brownies, and coffee). 5. May need to "park" ideas and move on. 6. "Caucus" outside of meetings. 7.
