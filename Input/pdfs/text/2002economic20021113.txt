BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 2150 L Wiltse for Economics/Operations Working Group.  11/13/2002 MEETING NOTES Page 2   BASELINE HYDROLOGY TEAMLET Bob reported that the candidate years being proposed are: Low: 1952 Med: 1962 High: 1968  (exceeded 91.4% of the time) (exceeded 50% of the time) (exceeded 10.34% of the time)  Each year in a cluster is economically neutral. He pointed out that for the low flow years, 9,600 cfs was never exceeded on a daily basis. For median and high years there are several daily occurrences above the 10K cfs threshold Bob asked for feedback from the group re: using these three years in the HYDROPS model for running various scenarios. We may also need to come up with some standard economic assumptions for the model. We agreed to run these years by the resource Working Groups. Bob will give the charts and data to the team leaders and also post the graphs on the web. DISCUSSION OF APPROACH TO ANALYZING FLOOD CONTROL AND DEVELOPMENT OF PROJECT OPTIONS Dave Brookings of Skagit County PUBLIC Works presented the county’s interest in maintaining/ optimizing flood control for Skagit Valley over the term of the next license period. They will complete the Skagit Valley flood study in 2004 at a cost of $8-million. Estimated constructions costs are $250million with county matching at 35%. These studies assume the continued existence of the current Baker Project Flood control storage. He passed out an August 7, 2001 resolution by the three Skagit County Commissioners that requests no net loss of flood control storage. He also presented the County’s testimony on the Baker Relicensing Initial Consultation Document asking for study of additional flood control measures. Ken Brettmann explained that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers would maintain the existing flood control levels at 74,000 Acre Feet, (as a floor), leaving open the potential of additional flood storage up to 26,000 Acre Feet. A study to this effect may be justified as part of this relicensing effort. The focus has been on volume, but there is also the issue of timing. For now, we will assume the timing would also remain the same (making 74,000 Acre Feet available by November 15) with any changes in timing shifting to earlier in the year. (E.g. October). Ken handed out a letter from the COE to the economics group asking the economics group to formalize the existing flood control storage and timing and use this as a basis for further analysis. He also distributed a new draft of Article 32 dealing with flood control in the current license. Another part of the Army Corps of Engineer’s interest is based on minimizing costs to the federal government. Mark Killgore presented a review of House Document 95-149 (May 7, 1977) which was the basis for the Congressional resolutions in 1977 and the August 2001 Baseline Economics and Skagit River Draft Hydrology Investigations. In 1977 the 100-year flood peak on the Skagit of 237,000 cfs. This was reduced to 222,000 cfs in the 2001 studies. Control analysis in 2001 has no flood control at Lower BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 2150 L Wiltse for Economics/Operations Working Group.  11/13/2002 MEETING NOTES Page 3   Baker, Diablo or Gorge Dams. Control procedure has outflow from Ross and Upper Baker equal to inflow until 8 hours before Skagit River at Concrete is forecast to reach 90,000 cfs. Outflows then are restricted to 5,000 cfs at Upper Baker and at Ross. The current 74,000 AF was based on 58,000 AF of incremental storage beyond the 16,000 AF of lost valley storage producing a maximum benefit-cost ratio of 2.6 in the 1977 study. The 1977 incremental benefit from Upper Baker flood control for the Skagit was over $1,004,000. The cost of lost energy and capacity in 1977 was estimated as $434,000 based on replacement energy and capacity estimates for new facilities. As of the year 2001, PSE is compensated about $280,000 per year in equivalent power. In 2001 the net incremental benefits of Upper Baker would be $16,000,000, assuming a comparable ratio of Upper Baker flood control benefits to overall flood control benefits from the combination of Upper Baker, Ross and levee system as was determined in 1977. If these costs and benefits specifically attributable to Upper Baker could be borne out by more detailed study, the benefit cost ratio could be over 60:1 using the current level of compensation as a basis for cost. Some key storage and elevation parameters for flood control in Upper Baker include: 126,950 AF elevations: 694 fmsl to 724 fmsl physical limits. 100,000 AF elevations: 701.9 fmsl to 724 fmsl by statute 74,000 AF elevations: 707.8 fmsl to 724 fmsl Memorandum of understanding, 7,000 MWh.  Several questions remain today as to what are the benefits of Upper Baker flood control. Additionally there is interest in how the Corps methodology for flood control assessment and economics might have changed. Bob Barnes presented a DRAFT working paper “Baker River “No Project” or partial Decommissioning Alternative and Flood Control.” Bob pointed out that for single purpose projects “No Project” typically looked at the no-dam scenario where inundated lands would rejuvenate back to former uses. However, Baker Project has evolved into a multi-purpose project. At the last Economics WG meeting the COE indicated that over the last twenty years Upper Baker has saved over $90,000,000 in flood damage reduction. The average annual cost to the Federal Government is $276,000. Skagit County observed that Upper Baker is the least cost option for flood control available to the county, who is planning on a $275,000,000 flood control project. The climatic future of the North Cascades indicates a scenario with potential of flooding increasing. A “non project” may be more operational in nature than physical. That without PSE, an entity like the COE would operate the project to fulfil their flood control mandate and that entity may elect to generate power (it should be noted that the assumed takeover of the Baker Project by the COE is speculative and would require a future act of Congress to implement). Operational priorities for the project would become flood control, fish passage, water conservation/flow augmentation, recreation and power production. In subsequent discussions, Dave Brookings indicated that current flood studies on the Lower Skagit cost about $8 million and the county bears half the cost. Projects built as a result would likely have a 65% federal – 35% local cost sharing arrangement. The current flood studies should be complete BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 2150 L Wiltse for Economics/Operations Working Group.  11/13/2002 MEETING NOTES Page 4   in 2004 and recommendations could be incorporated in to the 2006 Water Resources Development Act. Groundbreaking for any new flood control measures could occur in 2008 or 2009. A key element is the 5-mile long Avon floodway. ASSUMPTIONS AROUND FLOOD CONTROL The Solution Team has asked us to come up with a statement re: assumptions around flood control to share across Working Groups. Lloyd suggested we use Marian Valentine’s opening statement in her letter of November 13, 2002: “to formalize the existing flood control as a basis of further work”. Stan felt this would be pre-mature as it might preclude proper evaluation of environmental considerations. We agreed that Upper Baker would continue to be used for flood control over the term of the new license. We also agreed that the existing baseline condition is the current flood control authorization of 74,000 AF. Jon suggested we consider a statement assuming the level of flood control to be the existing 74,000 AF plus or minus 20%. This translates into running PME options through the HYDROPS model at the existing level, then again at plus 20% and finally at minus 20%. Another option is to consider that flood control would remain at 74,000 AF and only consider plus or minus 20% if a PME called for that evaluation. Given that the FERC license specifies up to 100,000 AF of flood control, it may be reasonable to consider alternative ranges from 60,000 AF to 120,000 AF. Ken and Dave expressed concern about a statement coming out of this group that might infer a decrease in existing levels of flood control. Lloyd suggested the “political reality” would not allow us to drop below the existing 74,000 AF. We also need to take into consideration instream flows and timing. It was also brought up that Lower Baker may be a viable option for augmentation of flows where it is not seen (by COE and PSE) as viable for flood control as built. It was generally agreed that the issue of including a flood control regime into the three baseline scenarios was a policy call and would be reported to the Solutions Team. HYDROPS UPDATE Jon Vanderheyden reported that Stetson Engineering is still in the process of reviewing the HYDROPS model. They have had technical difficulties getting access to the model and are currently visiting Powel in Victoria. We will get their evaluation at our December meeting. REVIEW ISSUE LIST AND BEGIN TO BRAINSTORM POSSIBLE PMEs Mark Killgore handed out a “Draft of Economic Considerations in Evaluating Costs of PME Measures.” He compiled this list to assist preparation of the preliminary Draft Environmental Assessment. He looks forward to our feedback at our December meeting. In reviewing team members were also asked to take into consideration the initial lists of issues and interests put forth by this group distributed by Lloyd at our last meeting. Bruce cautioned us that many of the items on that list contained issues that are being BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 2150 L Wiltse for Economics/Operations Working Group.  11/13/2002 MEETING NOTES Page 5   addressed by other Working Groups. One of the first things we will do next month is narrow this list by pointing out which issues are being covered elsewhere.
