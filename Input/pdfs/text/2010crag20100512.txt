PROJECT UPDATES Lower Baker FSC <ad> Elizabeth presented an APE for the LB FSC and reviewed recent history of the development of the project and CRAG's participation. She proposed that the APE for this project be  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT FERC PROJECT NO. 2150033, 027   Cultural Resource Advisory Group 5/12/10 Notes, Page 2 of 6    Meeting Notes May 12, 2010 / 9:30 a.m. <ad> 3 p.m. / Sammamish Rm, Web-X, Call  expanded to include the Lower Baker Dam and Power House as there are upcoming projects in those areas of the Historic District. Elizabeth described the upcoming projects. A new, third powerhouse will be constructed. The original 1924 power house is buried under a landslide, and the current power house, which will remain, is non-contributing. The new power house will be approximately 90% underground; a new tunnel will also be constructed in the bedrock where the original tunnel is located. A Lower Baker Dam Crest Improvement Project is also proposed to meet license obligations. The dam is a contributing resource to the BRHDHD. There may be an adverse effect if the structure is modified and if the appearance is altered. The gatehouse, also a contributing resource, may also be modified. Russell asked about the configuration of the APE for the LB FSC Project (LB Barge, contributing resource). Elizabeth explained that the APE includes anchor points, constructions staging areas (boat launch), a new pier structure, and any modification to existing roads. She reviewed some of the topography and issues relating to the project to get Russ up-to-date with the rest of the group which went on a field trip to the area. Jan commented that an expanded APE allows for the more comprehensive approach to addressing effects to the historic district. The APE will be differentiated for archaeological and historic elements. Russ commented that there needs to be a way to take in indirect and visual impacts, etc. Elizabeth mentioned that there is 15-25 feet of fill on top of glacial material where the power house will be built that will need to be evaluated. There may be historic materials, like metal, wood, etc mixed into the fill materials. The railroad grade has not been located in the powerhouse area, although historic maps show one going to the original powerhouse. The only railroad grade located was in association with the Adult Fish trap Project in the vicinity of the Great Northern trestle remains (lower compound near visitor's Center). Elizabeth will initiate surveys on the FSC area and look at the dam and power house sites to see if any archaeological surveys are necessary. She will give recommendations to CRAG/SHPO. ACTION: Elizabeth and NWAA: Revise APE to include LB FSC, LB Dam, and LB Power House projects and distribute to CRAG and SHPO with narrative description. Stabilization The Design Team has developed concepts/schematics. Elizabeth will meet with them next week and has invited a hydrologist (water quality) to consult on permitting. This is on target for 2011 implementation during the work drawdown scheduled for winter/early spring. Lake Shannon monitoring Monitoring may be done at Lake Shannon if there is a drought drawdown. Recent rainfall has increased the volume, so this may or may not happen. Monitoring results Chris reported the monitoring form seems to work. All the data will be shared with CRAG and SHPO. The latest report shows subsidence and erosion at the armored site. The cause of the subsidence appears to be settling of the armoring. Foot traffic may need to be diverted; the area is fragile. There are picnic tables in the area. Perhaps the new site should be armored higher and further up the bank to compensate for expected settling.

And send monitoring report findings to CRAG and SHPO.  FS Road 1106 Jan reported that the APE for FS 1106 will be expanded to allow for a larger disposal site near the bone yard area. This will involve a new survey and will be handled through the FS internal process.  ACTION: Jan Share survey results on FS 1106 project with CRAG.  HPMP REVISION UPDATE Check In on Review Process Elizabeth reviewed the HPMP finalization schedule. All comments are due June 1 to PSE. They will be compiled and addressed, and a final HPMP will be produced and sent out for official 30-day review on July 2. Comments will be due back Aug. 2. Comments will be addressed and sent to FERC for final submission with final HPMP by September 30. FERC will not solicit comments.  Russ asked whether the HPMP covers all effects as it seems to address only direct or indirect. Do temporary or cumulative effects need to be addressed? This was discussed and this is a NEPA term, not Section 106. An adverse effect is an adverse effect as defined in Section 106.  Elizabeth called attention to the HPMP items sent to CRAG for review by email.  LUNCH <ad> We had our usual working lunch.  Historic Buildings & Structures (HPI Update) Heather reviewed the HPI table she had emailed to CRAG. It summarizes the status of the historic structures and will be attached as an addendum to the HPMP. Nothing has been found non-contributing that was previously determined to be contributing. Heather reviewed some of the changes. The update is posted on the FTP site.  ACTION: Heather Send Russell an export file of the HPI report  Jan asked about Bear Creek Dam on Rocky Creek. All data and records seem to point to these dams as part of the Superior Portland Cement Company history and not the Washington Portland Cement Company history (PSE HD).  ACTION: Heather Research previous notes on Bear Creek dam on Rocky Creek to verify it is not related to the Washington Portland Cement Company historic district.  DECISIONS FOR NEXT MEETING: None known  EROSION PLAN UPDATE No report. There were no concerns at this time.  PROTECTIVE OPTIONS This item was included in Project Updates.
