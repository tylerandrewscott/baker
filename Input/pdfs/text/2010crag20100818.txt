We will continue checking with folks at each of the resource groups and the BRCC to see if a license or settlement walk-through this fall is warranted. The aim of this would be to bring new members up to speed on the content of the license and to review its terms and conducts for existing members who want a refresher.  HPMP PROCESS UPDATE Comments on the Final Draft HPMP were due August 2. They will be addressed and sent to FERC for final submission with final HPMP by September 30.

This will form the letter that we send to FERC as a separate document (not part of the HPMP). Jessie will ensure Johanna has updated maps. After some discussion we agreed to keep Appendix E (list of preservation briefs) even though doing so may be viewed by FERC as overkill since the briefs are also in the Maintenance Guidelines. Jessie will send final revisions to Elizabeth by August 27. PROJECT UPDATES Discussion was deferred as we did not have attendance by CRAG members. LUNCH <ad> We had our usual working lunch.
