APPROVAL OF JUNE 16, 2009 MEETING NOTES We reviewed and approved the draft June Meeting notes with a minor edit. BRCC UPDATE Cary reported that they are moving BRCC meetings to a semi-annual schedule. PSE has periodically sent out a written update of the activities of each of the resource working groups to all in lieu of the meetings. At the September 23, PSE hosted a formal walk-through of the license to assist newcomers (and refresh Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 RRG Final Meeting Notes October 20, 2009 Page 1 of 3 old timers) in their understanding of the document. In lieu of an October meeting, PSE will email an update of what is happening in each of the resource groups. BAKER RESORT REDEVELOPMENT Cultural Disposition Shortly after the last meeting, the cultural report was out and has been approved by the Forest Service. 4(e) All the Team leaders need to understand the 4(e) process paper. Greta is working with Kim to get a 2 year rolling view of upcoming projects. All team leaders will be alerted to anything being done on USFS lands. Environmental Update Environmental Update Hazmat will be done separately – by environmental services. Everything is ready for that. We have gotten the go-ahead from PSE Environmental Services that no permits are required. When PSE took over the resort there was some major clean-up due to some residual contamination from some diesel tanks on the property. Testing in that area will occur in the near future. Pam and Greta will walk the site on October 28 so the FS can verify that the decommissioning is complete. Jon V also has this on his calendar. They will be looking at everything but the hazmat. PSE will pay for any costs associated with any clean-up that needs to be done. Note: Two of the cabins were moved to Gordon Iverson’s property. The rest were scrapped. Decommissioning Schedule The start date for demo was September 29, 2009. Pam reported that the demo and debris removal will be complete today. She walked us through some photos of the demolition. The decommissioning process should be complete by November 15, 2009. Water Safety Plan (SA 304) Pam reported that this plan was submitted to FERC on September 20, 2009. Aesthetics Plan (SA 302) Pam is in the process of reviewing Sergio’s initial draft of this plan. It will be reviewed by the RRG at the December 15 meeting. LAW ENFORCEMENT PLAN The LEP is in outline form. Pam sent it out to attendees of the LEP meeting today. We have 3 years to develop the plan. Today will be the 2nd meeting. RAM (Recreation Adaptive Management) FUNDING The Forest Service will be requesting that the first year of RAM funding be allocated to the shortfall for the Resort construction. Instead of looking at two years in a row, the FS would appreciate access to that first year sooner, in time for the next construction season. They would likely ask for the first two years in time for the construction season. They will make a proposal to do so and we till make a decision on this at our next meeting. Next Step: This will be in our agenda as a decision for the December 15, 2009 meeting. RECREATION IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE Pam will define tasks and times for the next two years. She will use a model developed by Greta to do Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project No. 2150 RRG Final Meeting Notes October 20, 2009 Page 2 of 3 this. We will review this at our December 15 meeting.
