S. Seattle, WA 98188  MEETING NOTES Mission Statement: To develop an efficient fish passage design for the Baker River Project. Attendees:  Arnie Aspelund, PSE Kevin Brink, PSE Doug Bruland, PSE Cary Feldmann, PSE Steve Fransen, NMFS Mort McMillen, M-W  Ed Meyer, NMFS Wayne Porter, PSE Fred Seavey, USFWS Nick Verretto, PSE Stan Walsh, SSC Lyn Wiltse, PDSA Consulting  Purpose:  The purpose of the meeting was to continue the conceptual design process for replacement of juvenile fish passage facilities at the Baker Project.  Note: Future meeting dates are: 19 October and 16 November, 2000, 9:00 to 3:00 at the West Coast Sea-Tac Hotel.  Agenda: 1. Review notes/agenda 2. Action items/parking lot review 3. Continue brainstorming downstream passage solutions and review results of teamlet 4. Meeting evaluation 5. Set agenda for next meeting Review notes/agenda: BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT FERC PROJECT NO. 2150   No changes to the agenda or meeting notes were recommended.  New Action Items: • Review brainstorming passage ideas matrix for continued development at next meeting. • Bring questions regarding additional information needs and studies development. • Nick will produce additional bar chart of gulper pump cycle test data. “Old” Action Items: • Fred will bring Skagit Chinook length-frequency data.  • Fred will look at statistical variation from year to year in the gulper mark and recovery data (by September).  • Kevin Brink will analyze how fluctuation limits affect spill (# events, amounts, seasons, duration, flowdays by month), to facilitate discussions regarding limits to drawdown range and effects on screening designs. Kevin will report at the October 19th meeting. •  Fred will look at statistical variation year-to-year in the gulper mark and recovery data (by October).  Report on Completed Action Items: • Nick distributed data on gulper pump cycle (every 24 hours) test. The x-axis appears to be incorrect, but the y-axis is correct and it yields the important data. The numbers appear to be too small to be statistically significant. He has copies of the data available on disk for anyone who wants to play with it. Nick will produce bar charts for the next meeting, and correct x-axis errors (overlapping dates) present in the line plots. • Nick reported that he was unable to get the Hydrolab working, but that temperature data collection had been initiated using a combination of a portable meter and data loggers located at the gulper. PSE began in September taking weekly Lower Baker vertical column temperature data at 10-ft. increments from 100’ to the surface. Additional depth measurements have been initiated with data loggers at depths of 150’ and 200 feet. Similar data is being collected from the Upper Baker gulper, with two data loggers deployed at 190’ and 225’ (depth from the surface). Parking Lot: • Hydroacoustic data - Arnie • Fish species run timing, emergence timing, length-frequency data – Doug, Nick • Design strategy process • Conceptual designs as they relate to costs • Sediment studies Continue Brainstorming Downstream Passage Solutions and Review Results of Teamlet: The teamlet (consisting of Ken Bates, Wayne Porter, Kevin Brink, Nick Verretto, Cary Feldmann, Dennis Dorratcague and Mort McMillen) put together a potential solution matrix (with much thanks to Ken) with some rating criteria. Nick distributed hard copies of the matrix, consisting of the list of brainstormed options developed in the last meeting (listed below), which were then rated in a systematic way by the meeting participants. Team members provided review, asking clarifying questions and revising the ratings BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT FERC PROJECT NO. 2150   in the process. They reiterated that the matrix is just a tool to help the team accomplish its mission, and that no one will be held accountable for particular ratings down the road. Each option was listed as either primary or secondary – primary options consisting of those which would function as stand-alone facilities, and secondary options being support or ancillary facilities. Options were then rated on a scale of 0-6 regarding effectiveness in addressing the five areas of concern identified in the last meeting (i.e., “works well for fish”, “. . .all life stages”, “. . .operations”, “. . .economics”, “. . .other interests”). A score of 0 was considered a fatal flaw which would remove the option from further consideration, and a score of 6 indicated the highest effectiveness at addressing the concern. Each of the five areas of concern was given a relative weight, the sum of which was 100% (this was done by each individual, then the mean calculated based on relative participation of PSE and agency representatives). Final scores were given each option, representing relative effectiveness, and the list reorganized by score for further discussion. The original & organized matrices and the linked scoring sheets were copied onto disk and distributed at the end of the meeting, and are an attachment to these minutes. Participants are to review the list prior to the next meeting and be prepared to continue discussions leading to the identification of several options for conceptual design development. All options should be considered in the context of what additional information, if any, is needed to provide confidence in acceptance of the option for further development. This will fuel discussion at the next meeting regarding future study needs. The revised matrix will be available on the web site. 1.
