The highlights of this update include:  Shoreline permit hearing 3/12 in Concrete  SEPA completed 1/12; adopting NEPA document  CZMA: requesting deadline extension to 3/30  Water Quality Certification: 3/1  BiOps: Coming soon! Expected by end of this week or early next week. Easements: Tony met with PSE’s legal folks to discuss PSE’s approach to easements. The bottom line is that we need to show what any specific proposal would mean to PSE. Tony created a Matrix describing the different types of easement options, including: ownership, conservation easement, conservation easement, purchased / other easement, and life estate. The matrix covers a high-level explanation of each option, specific considerations, pros, cons, and FERC implications. Land Acquisition: We reviewed the status of the initial parcel and possible alternate parcels, and gave Ray feedback / input on our priorities relative to both easements and possible trades. Pre-acquisition studies: the only changes the TRIG is proposing to the pre-acquisition studies has to do with the wetland portions, so the documentation we developed for the 3 other parcels we reviewed last year will work for us. Elk Summit: Brock has the OK to bring folks together. We need:  Management guidelines, specific to our planning questions  List of Questions (Tony, Anna & Brock will develop for TRMP review)  Invite full TRMP and WDFW Next Steps:  Tony, Anna & Brock – Work toward “Elk Summit” … develop agenda and list of Q’s (ex: are there specific restrictions on lower parcel?)  Ray will continue to explore interest alternate parcels / trade possibilities  Tony will continue to work toward PSE decision re: easements Baker River Project Relicense Elk Teamlet Meeting Notes, February 20, 2007  Page 2 of 3 FERC Project NO. 2150     We believe we are getting close to a decision, so Tony and Ray will go ahead and initiate the Land Acquisition Team with Tony, Terry, Kendall, Marty, Ray, Mike and Sally (? – RMEF’s legal).
