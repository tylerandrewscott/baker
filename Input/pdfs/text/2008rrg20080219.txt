Dave: Look for past surveys re. Marbled Murlette, Spotted Owl Pam: Check with Nick re. field trip dates for FSC – let team members know. Pam: Bring “Plan” version of PM gates to next meeting for review. Pam: Bring detail of each of the PM gates for all to review at next meeting. FERC / BRICC STATUS The BRICC met in January and discussed response to proposal by Diking Districts and the Cities of Burlington and Mt. Vernon to amend the Settlement Agreement. No BRICC members responded affirmatively and the issue is now closed. Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 RRG Final Meeting Notes, February 19, 2008  Page 1 of 4   During the January BRICC meeting they also reviewed implementation of Article 601: Decision making for resource groups. Steve Fransen reported the NMFS Bi-Op is now in the hands of NMFS lawyers. After their approval it will go to FERC who has assured us they will expedite the process to the extent possible. Article 601: Decision Process Flow Paul walked us through the flow chart outlining the consensus decision making process for resource groups. The intent is for most decisions to be made at the resource (technical) level. The sign-in sheet for each group will be formatted to illustrate members present in each of these groups (Federal, State, Tribes, Licensee) as required by the license. There are 2 ways to achieve this quorum. One is by attending the meeting in person. The second way is to send your vote via proxy. In situations like we have in the RRG, where we have no tribal representation, they may send their vote/approval through one of the other members. Next steps: Flesh out the “start here” piece, i.e., what constitutes a “decision”. Another aim of this flow chart is to institutionalize the process so it is applied consistently over the next few decades as team members come and go. While we need representation of the 4 groups to make a decision, all who signed the Settlement Agreement participate in decision making. Plans represent the boundaries of the playground. We will ask FERC to accept the process by which we make decisions and then report to them the specifics of what we have done in our annual report. This should help ensure that decisions are kept local. RECAP – 2008 CAPITAL PROGRAM The Settlement Agreement contains some requirements to construct projects regardless of when the license is issued, e.g., build Upper Baker FSC to be operational in spring of 2008 and at Lower Baker to be operational in spring of 2012. Paul walked is through a list of major construction projects for 2008. He outlined the 7 key project phases that PSE will be using as they construct these projects. The Upper Baker Hatchery may be held up based on permitting requirements (may be handled through special use permit or MOA). Paul also reviewed the status of other major 2008 projects, including: - LB Adult Fish Trap - LB Powerhouse Modifications - Elk Habitat Acquisition - Floating Loon Nest Platforms - Resource Redevelopment - Water Quality We discussed the need to “share the playbook” access each of the phases/gates. We will modify the gates to apply to our plan development for Articles 301-305, 308, 309, 318. Pam will bring a draft for us to Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 RRG Final Meeting Notes, February 19, 2008  Page 2 of 4   review/revise at our next meeting. TEAMLET UPDATE Pam reported that she, Ann and Jamie Van De Vanter met in November and visited the resort site and took pictures and identified the layout for each site. Jamie then drafted some ideas for circulation. They hope to be able to use existing roads. They also discussed how the function would change as it becomes more of a FS campground. They met again in December and began to lay out the schedules using MS Project through the first 6 years of license implementation, assuming a license is granted in April of this year. Jamie brought a drawing of the site layouts for them to review. We have a lot of construction projects – some owned by PSE, some by USFS, and some with shared ownership. They discussed a common framework for tracking progress. In January, they conducted a site review (including changes suggested at the last meeting) and also did more work on the schedule. They met again on February 11 to further refine the circulation patter (using existing roads), parking, etc. Plans are to be conservative in areas where Skunk Cabbage was found (link to wetlands). We will attempt to minimize impact on hydrology of that area (through construction and ongoing use). Next Steps: Pam will conduct an in-house review on February 26 with the aim of bringing a proposed drawing to our April 15 meeting for all to review. Few trees will be removed. This will be done in consultation with USFWS to address any potential impacts on Marbled Murrelet or Spotted Owl. PSE hopes the 2 years of survey for these species may not be necessary. REC PLANS / 2008 DELIVERABLES Pam reviewed with us the list of Articles that require plan development. We hope to have draft plans for Articles 301-305, 308, 309 and 318 complete by the end of 2008. EDAW will be assisting us with this process. PSE is working to standardize the model for plans across all resource groups. RRG has led the way on this with Article 303. RECAP OF RESORT OPERATIONS FOR 2008 In November of 2007, Joel Molander requested of Jon Vanderheyden that PSE be allowed to operate the resort on a reduced schedule: from mid-June to mid-September (90 days instead of 150 days of operation) to cut operating costs. PSE then met with the Forest Service again in February to review this plan which would also help with decommissioning. The Forest Service expressed concern about the impact on Memorial Day weekend and conflicts with FS campgrounds. As a result, PSE agreed to open May 22-27 and then re-open June 13 and close in mid-September. They won’t have to re-do the Special Use Authorization. Next Steps: PSE will inform the public about the new schedule. USFS ANNOUNCEMENT Ann announced that Rod Mace will be stepping back and Greta Movassaghi. will become involved as the new FERC Coordinator for the FS. Jon Vanderheyden will continue his involvement as District Ranger.
