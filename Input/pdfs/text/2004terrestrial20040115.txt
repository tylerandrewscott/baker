Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Terrestrial Resources Working Group RESOLVE Session, January 15, 2004  Page 2 of 6   • • • •  •  Lauri: Buttoned up with Carl, Tony (and Bob C?) on how to reword the Bald Eagle PME to reflect today’s discussions by the end of the year. Lauri: Updated draft of Wildlife Management Plan Outline to reflect recent PME discussions (PME Table, etc.). She emailed it out to the entire Working Group membership on January 14. Marty: Updated and distributed PME table to reflect today’s discussions and sent out for all to review. Gene: Set up conference call line for Dec. 11 conference call (9:30 to 11:30) and sent dialing instructions out to BAWG members. Sent out agenda of unresolved issues to guide the discussion including but not limited to the following: • Is it necessary to include MAP stations in PMEs? • What should 1.5.1 Discretionary Fund look like? • What should 1.6.3 Monitoring Fund look like? • What should 6.6 TERF Fund be? • 3.3.4 Bald Eagle integration with aquatics? • 1.3.3 Legacy Wood User reality check • 1.2.1: Don’s new cost estimate for Elk forage • Others? BAWG: Participated in Dec. 11 conference call.  BALD EAGLE PME (1.3.4) The desire is for this to be a joint PME with Aquatics. We may need to get more detail from Aquatics on their version of the PME (3.4.4). The BAWG believes that, until that piece is done, we can’t come to agreement on the whole package (and specifically on PMEs 1.1.1, 1.2.4, and 1.3.4). We agreed to move forward by drafting a PME that assumes we are addressing the bald eagle concern independent of what the Aquatics folks might do. This would serve as a placeholder until the Aquatics habitat restoration PME 3.4.4 is complete. At that time, our numbers could be adjusted accordingly, if we find the Aquatics PME covers all or part of the bald eagle concern. If this is not the case, our PME would stand. Don will write up a summary of what this PME might look like and get it out to team members to review. This will be based on the BAWG caucus this morning. They hope to have consensus on this by January 22nd. At that time, it will be routed around to the entire Working Group to see if we can come to agreement before the Solution Team Meeting on January 27th. At that (Solution Team) meeting, any PMEs/issues still unresolved will be assigned to the appropriate policy-level teamlets for resolution. REVIEW UPDATED PMES, FINALIZE TO TENTATIVE AGREEMENT LEVEL 1.1.1 Provide Habitats Total O&M Cost $270,000 (over 30 years) Annual = $9,000/year We changed the “Total O&M Cost” Column to “Annual O&M Cost” Will be contingent on what happens with the Bald Eagle PME/Aquatics 3.4.4 PME. 1.2.1 Elk Forage Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Terrestrial Resources Working Group RESOLVE Session, January 15, 2004  Page 3 of 6   Ready to go to Louis Berger to be translated into draft article language! 1.2.2 Grizzly Forage Ready to go to Louis Berger to be translated into draft article language! 1.2.3 Mountain Goats Ready to go to Louis Berger to be translated into draft article language! 1.2.4 Wetlands (previously Amphibians) Will be contingent on what happens with the Bald Eagle PME/Aquatics 3.4.4 PME. 1.2.5 Connectivity Ready to go to Louis Berger to be translated into draft article language! 1.3.1 Provide Osprey Nest Structures Ready to go to Louis Berger to be translated into draft article language! 1.3.2 Provide Floating Nest Platforms for Loons Marty suggested some alternate wording on the Description of Action for this PME, so that ownership and liability for doing this does not lie with either WDFW or PSE. 1.3.3 Legacy Wood Users Ready to go to Louis Berger to be translated into draft article language! 1.3.4 Bald Eagle PME Will be contingent on what happens with the 3.4.4 PME in Aquatics WG. In the interim, we will be moving forward with a PME that covers the terrestrial interests. Don drafting BAWG proposal for this PME, to be ready for review by Jan 22nd. 1.3.5 Bald Eagle Management on Project Lands Nests and night roosts would be addressed here. Money would be immediately available so there would be no annual O&M costs. Marty will ensure the wording doesn’t limit action to only one nest. 1.3.6 Bald Eagle Monitoring “During the first 3 years after acceptance of the license…” 1.4.1 Plants of Special Status Identify this is not a capped obligation. 1.4.2 Noxious Weeds Identify this is not a capped obligation, except for the $500K for reed canarygrass control. 1.4.3 Carex Flava Identify this is not a capped obligation. Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Terrestrial Resources Working Group RESOLVE Session, January 15, 2004  Page 4 of 6   1.6.1 Wildlife Plan Development We need to define objectives and lay enough ground rules about what the plan will/won’t do (in the Settlement Agreement) to be sure to capture everybody’s interests. Then, once we know more about the lands acquired, we could get more specific. Lauri (with input from the BAWG) has drafted a Management Plan Outline. We will work on this language with the aim of being able to attach the Management Plan Outline to the Settlement Agreement. The intent of the Management Plan is to track and guide the PMEs. It needs to be a dynamic document, reviewed and revised periodically, perhaps at least every five years or annually with a 5 year outlook. Note: We agreed to drop the Implementation PME (was 1.6.2) as elements of implementation are already covered in each of the PMEs 1.6.3 Compliance and Effectiveness Monitoring Lauri suggested that $100,000 would cover one baseline HEP study, which would be appropriate here. This was based on the HEP completed on the Lewis River. We would start with $100,000 and then provide another $100,000 every 20 years throughout the term of the license for a total of $200,000 (or $300,000 with a 40-year license). We agreed to state that we are assuming we will use HEP as the monitoring methodology. An alternate methodology could be used if so directed by the Baker River Coordinating Committee. GENERAL NOTES • How to track funds spent internally at PSE? (Cary will look into) • Education should be considered in the TERF • May want to cap what percent of funds can be used for closing costs, etc. FUNDING PSE has disclosed that $10.2MM (Face Value) is the outside boundary of what PSE Senior Management would support. We will continue to define the Terrestrial PME package in light of resource requirements, and then look at the dollars. By pushing some costs out into the future, we would be able to do more for less. Cary will send out a NPV (Net Present Value) spreadsheet to assist folks with this assessment.
