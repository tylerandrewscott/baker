We will spend the first day developing PMEs and the second day will be our regular meeting. 2003 Dates: January 14, February 11, March 11, April 8, May 13, and June 10. All regular attendees are encouraged to let Jessie know if they are unable to attend a meeting. November 5, 2002 AGENDA 1. Introductions 2. Review Minutes/Agenda 3.

Evaluate Meeting INTRODUCTIONS The group welcomed first-time attendee Ryan Booth, who manages the Visitors Center at North Cascades National Park. Ryan also assists the park superintendent with consultation and outreach with Skagit Valley tribes and other communities. NEW ACTION ITEMS • ALL: By November 20, give Jessie feedback on HRA’s Historical Resources Study Request. • Jan: Follow up with Chris re: status of archaeology survey previously done on Baker Lake Trail. • Larry: Run Unanticipated Discovery Plan (draft) by Marty Loesch for feedback. • Jessie: Check possibility of HYDROPS demonstration at a future meeting- January or February? • Jessie: Check with Joel Molander re: doing HYDROPS model demonstration for the Upper Skagit Tribe by end of the year. • Frank: Send Jessie sample Programmatic Agreements (PAs) to share with this group. • Jessie: Send out UDP for formal review. • Jessie: Send out official initial draft of APE asking for comments (include disclaimer re: changeability). REPORT ON OLD ACTION ITEMS • Jessie: Checked with members regarding proposed dates of next meetings. • Jessie: Checked with members re: recommendations to complete initial draft of APE. • Lyn: Called Jan Hollenbeck to check the status of ARPA permit and to verify that a cultural survey was done when the Forest Service constructed the Baker Lake Trail in the early 90’s. See paragraphs below. • Jessie: Reviewed the Forest Service Watershed Analysis for info related to cultural resources. • Jessie: Sent out results from Aquatic Erosion Study when they became available. • Jessie: Researched trails etc. to suggest what to include in APE. • Jessie: Continued research on land ownership around Lake Shannon. Scott Schuyler reported that the Upper Skagit Tribe has information related to land ownership around both lakes. He will follow up with Chris Miss. • Jessie: Worked with Tribes to confirm tribal crew members who will participate in archaeological work. ARPA PERMIT Jan reported that the Forest Service expects to issue the ARPA permit for archaeological work on Baker Lake by November 25. The law requires that all affected tribes receive a 30-day notice before issuing the BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 11-05-02 MEETING Page 2 Cultural and Historic Resources Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150 permit. She doesn’t anticipate any adverse reaction from the four tribes (Samish, Swinomish, Upper Skagit, Sauk Suiattle), since this is essentially the same study that the latter three tribes participated in designing and all the tribes reviewed for the previous ARPA permit. BAKER LAKE TRAIL Depending on the character of the undertaking, an additional archaeological survey may be required, regardless of whether it was surveyed in the past. PME APPROACH WITH DEE AND BRUCE Dee and Bruce explained how they have been working with other resource working groups to help capture draft options for potential Protection/Mitigation/Enhancement (PME) measures. Given the prescriptive nature of Section 106 requirements, we discussed how we might approach this process. We decided that Dee and Bruce will call participants of this working group between now and the next Working Group meeting (Dec. 9 and 10) to help form a preliminary list of what types of issues we should think of capturing. We will meet at the Baker Lodge December 9 from noon to 5:00. PSE will be providing lunch at noon. We hope to start the meeting by about 12:30. We will work with Dee and Bruce from 12:30 to 5:00 on fleshing out the preliminary list of ideas they got from team members from the phone conversations. The product of this discussion should assist us in communicating our ideas with the other resource working groups and the Solution Team. We will leave from the Lodge at 9:00 the morning of December 10 for a field trip, where we will observe the archaeology contractors at work. We will return to the Lodge at noon, have lunch, and then have our regular meeting from 1:00 to 3:00. ARCHAEOLOGY UPDATE – CHRIS MISS Chris Miss is the President of Northwest Archaeological Associates, which has been a company for 15 years. She has worked with several of our working group members in the past and has also worked on other reservoirs. She has a crew of six people currently working at Lake Shannon. They are testing three sites: one pre- historic site, an old homestead and a logging camp. The research design called for a 1m x 1m sample. Chris’s crew is being more thorough by using a combination of unit and shovel probes to get a more dispersed (and representative) sample. They have arranged to get small boats to assist them with evaluating some of the steep sites. The upper part of Lake Shannon will also be accessed by boat. The reservoir is now 12 feet higher than it was when they began work in mid-October. It is over 30 feet higher than when HRA conducted the survey initially. The report will keep site locations confidential as per the Communications Protocol. The rim survey has not been done. We will get as much done as possible this winter. We may have to wait until the spring to complete the survey around all the “bubbles” included as part of the APE. BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 11-05-02 MEETING Page 3 Cultural and Historic Resources Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150 APE Jessie reviewed the discussion that occurred last month with regard to completing the Area of Potential Effects (APE). Bob said he likes Jessie’s proposal to extend the APE (using a 100-meter buffer) to include areas that are already receiving noticeable impact, i.e., where there is a nexus to dispersed recreation sites, which often coincide with tributary streams, and certain types of land forms (flat areas). By doing this, we would include any possible articulation to upland areas. Bob said that it is positive to do 100-meter polygons as “bulges” in the APE because these areas also have potential for recreational developments in the future, which might involve ground-disturbing activities. Proposed APE for Archaeological Resources -Working Definition: • The minimum APE is the FERC boundary. • The APE is a living boundary and subject to change over time in response to new information and activity. • The APE will include “bulges” around any Project facilities and formal camping facilities that extend out beyond the FERC boundary. • The APE will include a 40-meter zone extending above the high water mark of the reservoirs. • The APE will include any dispersed recreation sites that lie within a ¼ mile zone beyond the high water mark of the reservoir. • 100-meter buffer around "nexus" areas described above as well as around clusters of dispersed recreation sites along Baker Lake Trail. The Traditional Cultural Property (TCP) Study will likely create a separate APE, some of which may overlap with the APE for Archaeology..
