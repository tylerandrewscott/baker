Print out at large scale (showing roads and site numbers). · Chris: Route around R2 viewshed map when available. · Tony: Create list of all different studies going on in the different Working Groups. · Tony: Work with R2 to develop GIS overlays for ownership, zoning, wetlands, etc. · Ardis: Discuss Water Quality study request with Greta. · Tony: Get a summary of water quality data being gathered by PSE (what when, where). · Tony: Talk with Nick and Arnie re: water quality.  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT FOR 9/24/01 MEETING NOTES L Wiltse for Recreation Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 2   REPORT ON OLD ACTION ITEMS · Tony/Chris: Discussed what fishing information is needed and how best to gather it with Nick and Arnie and invite them to attend our September or October meeting. · Tony: Checked on availability date of the PSE Operational Model. Invite Bob Barnes to do demo. · Tony: Checked availability of Mt. Vernon PSE Office for November 19 meeting. · Chris: Got GPS data for dispersed sites to R2 so they can add them to the maps. · Chris: Revised draft of R11, creating a study plan (keep R15 separate). DOCUMENT UPDATE Watershed Analysis should be out to PSE and other contributors (agencies and tribes) this week for comment. It will probably be November before it’s out for broad consumption. The PSE’s ICD (Initial Consultation Document) is in the final phases of editing and will go out in October-ish. It will be available in hard copy and CD format. FERC BOUNDARY UPDATE FERC announced that the closing period for comments re: including transmission lines in the boundary is October 19. PSE has notified all Solution Team members of this date. TROUT STOCKING ISSUE WDFW feels the current trout-stocking program is a recreational issue and should be considered part of the relicensing process. PSE feels that this voluntary program should be dropped since agency folks on the Aquatics Working Group (and the Baker River Committee) have stated they oppose the stocking of non-native (Goldendale) rainbow trout. Anyone who wants a recreational fishing enhancement program should propose it in the form of a study request. It seems that no one wants to own this. We discussed the importance of relying on existing facts and data before proposing any P/M/E measures. PSE has collected some data from opening day creel surveys. We also have access to WDFW summer creel data that Brady obtained. We will review the data and determine (1) if a recreational fishing enhancement program is needed and if so…(2) What should it be? PSE OPERATIONAL MODEL PSE will be getting the model in October and will be looking for scenarios to run e.g., what happens to reservoir elevations, fish flows, if we have the reservoir full longer (for boat ramp access). This will also give us an indication of impacts on power generation and other resource areas. We’ll see if we can get a demonstration scheduled between now and the end of the year. HANDOUTS · Recreation Capacity & Suitability Analysis Draft study plan 9/21/01 STUDIES UPDATE R9 RECREATION USE SURVEY – ELECTRONIC MONITORING All 5 tube counters were removed the week of September 10. The data are in the process of being crunched. We still plan to install permanent counters on Road 11, north of the Road 12 junction, and east of Upper Baker Dam on Road 1107 past the turnoff to Crown Pacific lands A.S.A.P. In the meantime, BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT FOR 9/24/01 MEETING NOTES L Wiltse for Recreation Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 3   we’ll have a temporary counter reinstalled on Road 11. Ann shared with Chris traffic count data for summer 2001 from 4 Forest Service counters on Road 11 (which Ann recently learned about). R7 +R8 = R14: SECONDARY DATA COLLECTION On hold (not time sensitive…) R12 DEVELOPED AND DISPERSED SITE INVENTORY We sent our file of dispersed site GPS locations to R2 to map. There are plans to check/refine the inventory during fall survey work (to record some sites that may have been missed and some new ones that have been created). R13 RECREATION VISITOR SURVEYS We operated two field crews through September 16. One crew will continue to work full time through mid-November. Since the last meeting (through September 8), we collected 94 Baker Lake Drop Box Surveys and 10 Shannon Drop Box Surveys for total of 104. We completed 51 Baker Lake interviews and 10 Lake Shannon interviews for a total of 61. Drop Box through September 8 – Cumulative Total = 371 Interviews through September 8 – Cumulative Total = 249 TOTAL 620 Between now and mid-November we will allocate more field survey effort to roadside intercepts (because many of the developed sites are or will be closing, and there will be less overnight use). We will also continue driving and boating around to see what activities folks are engaging in. ANALYSIS OF STUDY RESULTS We need to compile and tabulate the inventory data we’ve collected. The analysis that comes from this will feed into R11: The Recreation Capacity & Suitability Analysis as well as the upcoming Needs Analysis. We all need to be thinking about how to “slice and dice” the data in meaningful ways. PSE is looking at using the Access database program as a standard project tool to hold and manipulate the data, so that will be one option considered for the survey data. We hope to have input of all survey data by year-end. STUDY REQUESTS R11: RECREATION CAPACITY AND SUITABILITY ANALYSIS Chris distributed a rough, partial draft of R11 study plan. Members will review this, particularly the objectives and description of tasks. Chris suggested that the initial task: Existing Capacity & Utilization be rolled into the Needs Analysis. He will create a rough draft of a Needs Analysis study plan for us to review at our October 22 meeting. R5: VISUALS AND AESTHETICS STUDY On hold until the viewshed has been defined. LAND USE At our last meeting, we decided that this Working Group would take the lead in land use analysis. Tony BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT FOR 9/24/01 MEETING NOTES L Wiltse for Recreation Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 4   will work with R2 to create appropriate land use GIS overlays. We should be looking at parcel status, to identify lands that have been subdivided but not yet developed, and projections of future growth near the project. WATER QUALITY Re: Forest Service Water Quality Study Request prepared by Greta Movassaghi (R-A13). There are components that would identify recreation-induced effects on water quality. Other components are much broader, considering large-scale biological processes, sedimentation, etc. This broader request for data is beyond the scope of this Working Group and inconsistent with the other component. PSE’s Project Information Package contains a summary of water quality data collected in past years, and should give an indication of past sampling coverage and the range of conditions. We’ll look at this again next month. PARKING LOT - Prioritize fish-related data (for database queries) - Visioning exercise - Organizational/agency goals - Operationally define “vicinity”, “watershed”, “project induced” - List authorities that this team must be aware of - Look at dispersed recreation with the Project as a whole. - Look into getting guest speaker from Seattle City Light - Tie education piece to ALL Working Groups - Hold periodic “outreach” meetings for feedback from other groups (hiking, horseback riding, etc.) - Land Management - SCORP data from Jim - Forest Service presentation of SMS - Trailhead surveys - Have demonstration of Charles Howard Model EVALUATION OF MEETING Things Done Well · Got out early · Rhonda and Andy’s presence · Thankful facilitator not contagious · Coffee and Bismarks · All Bismarks all the time · Good discussions/listening  Need for Improvement · Missed Dan and Jim · Want facilitator to get better (healthier, that is) BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT FOR 9/24/01 MEETING NOTES L Wiltse for Recreation Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 5   · ·  Bring tea and plastic ware Deer jokes  TENTATIVE AGENDA FOR OCTOBER MEETING October 22, 2001 Agenda – Forest Service/Park Service Building at Sedro-Woolley, WA (at second junction of Hwys 9 and 20, across from Dairy Queen) 9:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. NOTE: BRING LUNCH; BE PREPARED TO WORK THROUGH 1.
