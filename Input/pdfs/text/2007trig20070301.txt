The February 28th BRICC meeting has been cancelled and replaced with a written / emailed update. The highlights of this update include:  Shoreline permit hearing 3/12 in Concrete  SEPA completed 1/12; adopting NEPA document  CZMA: requesting deadline extension to 3/30  Water Quality Certification: 3/1  BiOps: have been written, will probably be submitted to PSE next week and the goal is to submit the final BiOps to FERC by 3/19 Osprey / Loon Teamlet Update: Tony reminded the TRIG that the Osprey / Loon teamlet chose to develop and place one loon platform on Lake Shannon this year, with two more to be placed in 2008 before the end of March. The design is nearly complete and the platform will be built and installed on March 19. The osprey platform may be placed at the same time; if not, it will be installed by the end of March. (Team leader note: the Loon platform was installed on Lake Shannon on March 19th, and the access restriction buoys and float ropes were installed on March 20th. Tentatively, the osprey nest platform will be installed in the first week of April, due to reservoir water level restrictions and crew availability. This date might change due to changes in water level. The reservoir needs to be at approximately 430’ to be able to access the stump the platform will be bolted on to.) Elk Update: Tony met with PSE’s legal folks to discuss PSE’s approach to easements, particularly relative to the “initial parcel.” He created a matrix describing the different types of easement options for the initial parcel, with an explanation of each option, considerations, pros, cons, and FERC implications. The Elk teamlet concluded that any of these would work so long as we can manage the property for Elk forage. PSE will need to know the details of any specific proposal in order to determine whether that would meet license requirements and financial agreements. The teamlet reviewed the status of the initial parcel and possible alternate parcels, and gave Ray feedback / input on our priorities relative to both easements and possible trades. They are also looking into hosting an “elk summit” to discuss larger management and planning goals / activities. Tony shared that, since the last Elk Teamlet meeting, PSE’s real estate agent has moved on to a new department; our new PSE realtor is Ira McDaniel. The next elk mtg. will be scheduled when needed. Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 TRIG Meeting Notes, March 1, 2007  Page 2 of 3   TRMP Review Marty noted that he has incorporated our changes to Chapters 3, 4, and 5. Our changes to Chapters 1 and 2 require extensive writing and are not yet complete. Tony projected our current draft TRMP onto a screen and made live changes as we continued to walk through the document chapter by chapter, starting with the Post-Acquisition Habitat Assessment section of Chapter 5 (Wetlands). When we got to section 7.4 (loon platform specifications), Tony noted that we have new information for this section based on the loon /osprey teamlet’s work. Tony and Anna will revise sections 7.4 – 7.6 for review at our next meeting. We will start next time at Chapter 7, Section 7.4.
