BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 6/24/2003 MEETING NOTES Page 2 Baker Solution Team-Lyn Wiltse, PDSA Consulting, Inc. Facilitator FERC PROJECT NO. 2150 • Connie: Call Louis Berger Group re: availability to participate by phone (if needed) for July meeting. • Connie: Attach a list of cross resource Working Group members to Solution Team notes. [See pg. 9 of notes.] • Pam: Draft August PDEA email notice for our review at July meeting. • Lloyd: Invite Paul Wetherbee to participate in July Solution meeting (if TST members agree that HYDROPS runs are ready for review). • Connie: Send draft of second FERC Semi-Annual Progress Report (January-June 2003) out to members for review by June 27. • All: Please get any comments (blatant omissions, etc.) on Semi-Annual Progress Report to Connie by July 8. • All: Consider time/location for Solution Team Party. Be ready to discuss at our July meeting. SETTLEMENT PROCESS UPDATE Settlement Outline Kris distributed copies of the settlement agreement outline which had been edited to reflect the changes suggested at the last Solution Team Meeting. This version of the outline has been shared with PSE attorneys Pamela Krueger and Lorna Luebbe. They will be working on adding “boilerplate” detail to the outline in time for us at our next meeting. Attorneys Concern was expressed about the timing around bringing the attorneys together. We need to manage the tension between getting them together early enough so they still have ownership of the document (format, etc.), and late enough so they have some substance to respond to. We may need to operationally define “boilerplate,” because it means different things to different folks. Dee shared the list of attorney contact information she has so far. All were reminded to get the contact information for their attorneys who will be involved in this process to Dee as soon as possible. The USFS attorney won’t be available to meet until the fall. Dee will continue to collect the names for now. After we see the boilerplate language next month, we can discuss when would be best to pull the attorneys together. The initial attorney meeting would include setting up communication and operating guidelines. This will help set them up to successfully review, edit and ultimately recommend approval of the settlement agreement. It was suggested that we expand the contact list to include areas of specific interest for each attorney (which areas of the settlement agreement they want to review, etc.). We decided not to do this because the attorneys will be serving the interests of their organizations reflected in their respective interest statements. Update on RESOLVE Sessions Dee reported that the Recreation, Terrestrial, and Aquatics Working Groups have set up separate RESOLVE sessions to further develop the PMEs from their resource areas. These separate meetings will take place this summer. By the end of September, the Solution Team will see how far the groups have progressed. BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 6/24/2003 MEETING NOTES Page 3 Baker Solution Team-Lyn Wiltse, PDSA Consulting, Inc. Facilitator FERC PROJECT NO. 2150 Note: Forest Service folks will attend RESOLVE sessions to the extent they are available this summer. Studies and field work will come first. At the Recreation RESOLVE session, they reached tentative agreement on four PMEs: 1. Safety, 2. Boating Hazards, 3. New Trails, and 4. ADA Compliance They have asked the Louis Berger Group to begin drafting corresponding license articles. The Terrestrial RESOLVE session also went well. They reached tentative agreement on osprey nest structures after reviewing the draft license article language. Next time they will be reviewing draft license language for three additional PMEs. The Aquatics folks have yet to hold their first RESOLVE session (see schedule below). The following is a list of currently scheduled RESOLVE sessions: Terrestrial: June 18, July 17, August 8 Aquatics: July 29, August 12, and August 25 Recreation: June 16, July 21, August 11 Process Change: Working groups will ask Louis Berger directly to begin drafting license articles when they have agreed on PMEs. Once the Working Groups have approved the draft language, it will be sent to the Solution Team to be incorporated into a more holistic view. (The original plan was to have the draft license articles go directly to the Solution Team for review.) Dee is reconstituting the Adaptive Management teamlet because this is being discussed within the context of several PMEs. Starting in July, we will begin status reports for all PMEs. SCHEDULE/TIMELINE Kris reported that there were no real changes to the timeline since last month. He will update the schedule to reflect planned discussions with the Counties and the Town of Concrete re: the shoreline development permitting process. PDEA Update The official deadline set by the Louis Berger Group for input into the October 1 version of the PDEA was June 2. The draft actions PSE submitted to the Louis Berger Group for drafting of the fall PDEA were distributed. Connie’s cover letter stressed that some of the draft actions reflect Working Group agreements while others do not. The official draft PDEA will be out October 1 for a 90-day public comment period. During this time, agreements made by Working Groups since the June 2 deadline will be integrated into the April 2004 final PDEA. At our July Solution Team meeting, we will discuss what will be involved in the Working Group review of the environment effects section of the PDEA. A draft of this section will be available by request on BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 6/24/2003 MEETING NOTES Page 4 Baker Solution Team-Lyn Wiltse, PDSA Consulting, Inc. Facilitator FERC PROJECT NO. 2150 August 1. Pam Klatt of the Louis Berger Group explained that this interim review of the PDEA was requested by the Terrestrial Working Group. The Louis Berger Group wants comments (notification of any “fatal flaws”) by August 15. After some discussion, we agreed to handle the environmental effects review by having the Louis Berger Group send out an announcement to all Working Group and Solution Team members saying that a preliminary draft of the environmental effects section of the PDEA is available upon request. Pam will draft this email notice for review at our meeting in July. The email will stress that any review would be only to look for fatal flaws. It was emphasized that the Louis Berger Group is trying to meet regulatory deadlines, while we are working on coming to agreement. FERC CONFERENCE CALL Keith did not call in today. Steve was unavailable for the call as he was on assignment in Montana. Flood Control Update Lloyd reported that a teamlet of the Corps, Skagit County, WDFW and PSE has been formed to address the issue of a feasibility study for additional flood control storage (approach and scope). TetraTech will write the feasibility study and the Washington Group will address any associated physical changes to project works. If the benefit/cost ratio isn’t found to be compelling, no future action would be taken. (The Corps has rigid standards around this ratio. It must be greater than 1.) The initial emphasis will, therefore, be on economics. By the end of August, we will know if the rough economics pan out. If they do, next steps might include incorporating environmental costs into the assessment. Assuming a positive feasibility study, the Economics/Operations Working Group will review the findings and agree on next steps. This would begin in the November time frame. At their June meeting, the Economics/Operations Working Group reviewed a preliminary paper put out by R2 Resource Consultants outlining some of the environmental impacts associated with flood control storage. Concern was expressed that work on flood control storage could cause a possible drain on already scarce resources supporting other parts of the relicensing process. Appreciation was expressed for PSE choosing to collaborate with the County and the Corps in doing the feasibility study. REPORT ON OLD ACTION ITEMS • Keith: Got dispute resolution case citation to Connie. She sent it out on June 3. • Lloyd: Buttoned up with FERC re: flood control study request after June 11, Economics/ Operation meeting. • Connie: Buttoned up with FERC re: Whatcom County and the Town of Concrete meetings re: Shoreline Development permitting process (fall timeframe). • Kris: Buttoned up with Lorna Luebbe (PSE attorney) re: expanding settlement agreement outline and boilerplate language. TST UPDATE BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 6/24/2003 MEETING NOTES Page 5 Baker Solution Team-Lyn Wiltse, PDSA Consulting, Inc. Facilitator FERC PROJECT NO. 2150 The Technical Scenario Teamlet (TST) last met June 6. Paul Wetherbee reported that their progress to date includes reaching the following agreements: • A “recent conditions” summary statement (that alternatives will be compared against); • The five energy years they will use to represent wet, normal and dry conditions, economics and biological considerations; • A consistent energy price schedule to use across all analyses; and • A draft ranking of the soft constraints (see explanation below). At the June 6 TST meeting, they met in person (rather that the usual conference call) and established six groups of relative soft constraint rankings (five according to the different resource areas and one overall ranking of soft constraints to allow for apples-to-apples comparison). HYDROPS Paul reported that the final set of software modifications should be delivered to PSE by the Powel Group on June 25. They expect the testing/debugging to be complete by June 27. The model should be considered complete at that time. There will be another in-person TST meeting on July 11. They will review a couple of “strawman” runs (a sample run for recent conditions and an additional run for proposed conditions). Along with these runs, they will review a corresponding full suite of post process analyses. R2 Model At the July 11 meeting, they will also be looking at integrating the R2 model by reviewing a proposed work plan for model linkages. Note: The R2 and HYDROPS models will be linked, not integrated. The hourly downstream routing of the R2 model should be complete by July 18. They are looking at mid August for the hourly habitat component as well as the daily. SEMI-ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORT TO FERC Connie reported that the second Semi-Annual Progress Report, a requirement of the ALP, is due to FERC July 19. She will get a draft of the report out to the Solution Team for review by June 27. All were asked to let her know of any glaring omissions by July 8. WHAT’S HOT IN THE WORKING GROUPS?
