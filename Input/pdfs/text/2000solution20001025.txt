Reference for those who aren't attending regularly. Define in Process Document how minutes will be used especially if have to default to traditional process. Post to website. Attendance: <b7> Need a norm on being here <ad> it's critical. Maybe miss 3 meetings in a row, you must get a replacement. Process Document may need to address following situations: <b7> What if still studying with no resolution in 2+ yrs? Have to have a process protocol for what we would do (i.e., here are the options, here is what we agree to do depending on results). Adaptive management approach <ad> build into the license? <b7> What if ALP doesn't reach settlement? How does the Proponent submit if no settlement agreement? (At Cowlitz, submitted what all but 2 parties agreed, went into post-filing settlement work.). <b7> Acronym list for these meetings  LICENSING PROCESS REVIEW <b7> Handouts: 1) What is Relicensing?, 2) Relicensing Process Structure, 3) Schedule BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 10/25/2000 MEETING NOTES Baker Solution Team FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 3   <b7> Current 50-year license expires April 30, 2006; must file license application by April 30, 2004 <b7> Two processes: o Traditional three-stage consultation process <a7> Stages 1 and 2: Licensee compiles info, conducts studies, files application <a7> Public, agencies: attend meetings, review documents <a7> Stage 3: FERC evaluates application, conducts NEPA environmental review, issues license decision o Alternative licensing procedures <a7> Combines stages 1, 2 and NEPA from stage 3 <a7> Collaborative process with all interests addressed <a7> NEPA, license application and settlement agreement filed together <b7> Advantages and disadvantages to both processes <b7> Relicensing activities to date: o Public information meetings held in March, April and July o Public project tour in July (91 participants) o Project Information Package (PIP) distributed in July o Salmon History distributed in July o Six working groups started in May <ad> 6 monthly meetings so far o Process Working Group: drafted Communications Protocol and Process Document o Participated in Watershed Analysis for Baker basin being drafted by Forest Service <b7> FERC has to approve use of Alternative Process <ad> they have to commit to participate in process also. <b7> Steps after approval: Notice of Intent, Initial Information Package submitted, official public meeting, scope issues, environmental studies, environmental assessment process (preliminary draft environmental document <ad> FERC finalizes), submittal of documents. <b7> Need to identify issues at the front end of the process. <b7> FERC rule 596 <ad> consensus defined as "general agreement" or "collective opinion: the judgment arrived at by most of those concerned." PSE would in its request indicate this group's support to proceed with the alternative procedures. <b7> If Tribes go ALP route depends on what the ground rules are going to be. <b7> Baker Solution Team <ad> represents all real interests is the intent. Next level interest clarification and resolution is the Policy Solution team. We need to talk about how decisions are made for each entity in the Solution Team and/or Policy Team <ad> who has what authority? We are missing eight of the players of this team <ad> can't really make any substantive decisions, etc., without them <ad> critical to be present from the start. <b7> Two main concerns: 1) Cost of the process and 2) spectrum of interests from citizens to mandatory conditioning of agencies. Process where no one loses or is left out is the ideal. <b7> Schedule <ad> o ALP request <ad> no hard and fast deadline. o Relicense NOI no sooner than 5<bd> years before expiration of current license. Must file by April 30, 2001. o Process Document <ad> is part of the filing for ALP; included with Communications Protocol and letters of support. o Initial Information Package (revision of Project Information Package) out by May 30, 2000.  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 10/25/2000 MEETING NOTES Baker Solution Team FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 4   o Studies Phase <ad> conducted over 2+ years <ad> Depends on the working groups doing work. Don't know what studies must be done yet. How will studies get done in 2<bd> years? Many fish studies take 5- 6 years. o What would happen if studies aren't done? Define process for delayed resolution. Put in stipulations about ranges for studies if don't have results: "if result is ____, then ____ will happen." o About 2/3rds through the studies phase, likely start on the initial settlement agreement as we get consent on things. o Some studies must be finished before settlement proceeds: ESA , Sect 18 and 4e of FPA and Clean Water Act for example. If a study is tied to things that would supersede the FERC process, then must complete these if data are needed before the process would move on. Need to get the tail-wagging-the-dog issues soon as we can.  DRAFT MISSION STATEMENT The purpose of a mission statement is to guide team actions and intentions and guard against the dreaded "scope creep." The team reviewed a handout containing the mission statements from the six Baker Working Groups. The team will finalize the following draft mission statement at the December 13 meeting: By April 30, 2004, the Baker Solution Team will draft a settlement agreement and associated documents for relicensing of the Baker River Project that (best) meets the interests of the participants.  SETTING UP FOR SUCCESS With an eye toward re-creating the good things and guarding against the bad, team members cited the following success factors from previous projects with which they have been involved: Factors that Contributed to Success 1. Having documents prior to the meeting 2. Have revised documents show revisions (strike-through) 3. Have dated documents with page numbers 4. Have regular updates re: the schedule 5. Work on issues between (outside of) meetings 6. Keeping policy people current 7. Process checks/making good use of the "Parking Lot" 8. Respect for confidentiality 9. Good facilitation 10. Avoid personal attacks 11. Have a good pre-published agenda (this can help guide participant decisions re: which meetings to attend) 12. Attendance 13. Creativity on finding solutions 14. Contact list shared with all (email addresses included) 15. Members can write position note to distribute/discuss if they feel they are not being heard 16. Participants know what the law is 17. Meetings with time to introduce new topics and see where to put them in the agenda (build in flexibility) 18. Impartiality helps with closure on issues  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 10/25/2000 MEETING NOTES Baker Solution Team FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 5   19. Regular meeting times 20. Pre-announce agency caucuses (caucuses outside of regular meetings) 21. Stick to the agenda 22. Clarify meeting locations 23. Participants that are well prepared 24.

Uncomfortable room 8. No tea (coffee only) 9. Not being open up front with issues early in the process 10. People bringing past/current prejudices to the table  ALTERNATIVE LICENSING PROCESS REQUEST TO THE FERC <b7> Handout: Alternative Licensing Procedures <b7> Requirements for filing: cover letter, communications protocol, process document, and letters of support from major players. <b7> Communications Protocol <ad> 2 rounds of review so far; Process Working Group hopes to finalize Nov. 7; then send to Solution Team <b7> Process Document <ad> Process WG worked on it since July; Nov. 7 revise again; then to the Solution Team. Legal review of this should be concurrent with the Communications Protocol. <b7> Process for a document when it comes to Solution Team from Process WG: (A) members of Process WG all agree; (B) most agree, others note their issue; or (C) can't resolve issue, provide the Solution Team with alternatives and plusses/minuses. <b7> Process Document contains the "rules" <ad> need that first. <b7> Comments on draft documents to group/Connie by noon Nov. 6  PARKING LOT <b7> Members disclose legal requirements (perceived authority and responsibility) <b7> Members need to describe their roles in terms of decision-making authority in their organizations (this relates to who would be members of the Policy Solutions Team) <b7> Develop a template for Working Group recommendations <b7> Define a process for delayed resolution (based on incomplete studies) <b7> PSE provides their expectations of license legal ramifications <b7> Adaptive management: <b7> How can we take into account future technology, knowledge, conditions, resources, etc.?
