SETTLEMENT PROCESS UPDATE The facilitator team for the settlement process consists of Lyn Wiltse, Dee Endleman and Bruce Freet. Dee and Bruce walked us through the strategic steps toward coming up with a settlement agreement. The major steps are: 1. Prepare a framework for settlement (August-October 2002) 2. Produce PMEs and Agreement in Principle (AIP) (November 2002-March 2003) 3. Revise PMEs and develop management plans—preliminary terms, conditions and recommendations (March 2003-September 2003) 4. Develop Draft Settlement Agreement (September-October 2003) 5. Negotiate Final Settlement Agreement (October-February 2004) We agreed that we need to come up with some type of mechanism to address uncertainties (over the term of the license). Examples of uncertainties are climate changes, new research or technology advances. We also reviewed the major steps over the next six months that need to occur in order to come up with an Agreement in Principle (AIP). This will be a precursor to the draft settlement agreement. We agreed to go forward with this plan and will roll it out to the Working Groups starting in October. The Solution Team will play an important role in removing barriers to the process. We will also be identifying any gaps or overlaps across resource areas. The facilitator team will button up with the PDEA contractor to ensure they transition smoothly into the process. WHAT’S HOT IN THE WORKING GROUPS? AQUATICS • Instream flows • Flood control Things are running smoothly. Instream flow studies are underway. CULTURAL • Almost finished with APE • Interim plan BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 9/25/2002 MEETING NOTES Baker Solution Team-Lyn Wiltse, PDSA Consulting, Inc. Facilitator FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 3   They had tribal representation at the September meeting. They have brought on board new consultants to finish up the archaeological survey work and begin work on Traditional Cultural Properties. The study design will be revised to show an intent to do 100% coverage of the drawdown zone. Reasons for areas not covered will be provided (e.g., safety considerations, etc.). Dee will be attending the October meeting to begin the process of developing draft options for PMEs. RECREATION • Visioning Exercise – From 9 a.m.-1:30 p.m. on November 6 at the CottonTree Inn in Mount Vernon is when stakeholders with a cross-section of interests will participate in a visioning exercise. Some members are expressing concern about opening up this exercise to such a broad audience. Nearly 100 invitations are being sent out by the end of the month. It is important that they get good representation from many different stakeholder groups. TERRESTRIAL • Doubling up on meetings • Good collaboration! They are working through issues around the scope of the elk study and whether a HEP or alternate method would best serve as a vehicle to analyze/interpret the data they are getting from studies. These issues should be resolved prior to their October meeting. ECONOMICS • Finishing HYDROPS model • Setting hydrology baselines They are reviewing the issues they originally defined in January 2001. Dee will be attending their October meeting to begin the process of developing draft options for PMEs. FERC CONFERENCE CALL • FERC would notice the applicant-prepared Environmental Assessment and concurrently notice the Biological Assessment either as a separate document or within the Environmental Assessment. • Setting up schedule for regulatory meetings: October 31 from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at Dept. of Ecology in Bellevue • 401 Water Quality Certification • Coastal Zone Management Act • Shoreline Permit October 29 from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the USFS Building in Mountlake Terrace Attendance of NOAA Fisheries is essential, so we will plan around their availability. Define the processes for: • ESA • Section 18 • 4e • Who has signed up for the ALP “One of 10 Poster Children” process? • Kris Olin will get more information on this so we can make a decision at our October meeting whether or not to participate. • What’s up with Homeland Security? BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 9/25/2002 MEETING NOTES Page 4 Baker Solution Team-Lyn Wiltse, PDSA Consulting, Inc. Facilitator FERC PROJECT NO. 2150   •  • They will let us know when they know. Examples to help us wrestle with the uncertainty issue? • Mike will send Connie some sample settlement agreements to distribute. • Keith will send Connie a document containing examples of adaptive management examples to distribute.  SCHEDULES/STUDIES/STUDY TIMELINE Lloyd and Connie distributed updated (though not entirely complete) versions of these documents. They will be continually updated and posted on the web. Connie will also email out complete versions of the study matrix indices to members. NEPA CONSULTANT SELECTION Lloyd reported that PSE interviewed three firms regarding development of the NEPA document: Environmental Resources Management, EDAW, and Louis Berger/Meridian. Important considerations were local presence, ALP experience and EA experience. Louis Berger has been chosen. We are still fleshing out what their participation will look like. We don’t want their participation to interfere with Studies and other Working Group tasks. According to the Process Document, the Solution Team must approve the NEPA consultant selection. We agreed to move forward with Louis Berger. We look forward to meeting Rob Mohn, the Project Manager, at our next Solution Team meeting. HYDROPS UPDATE We hope to have all hydrology baselines by year-end and outputs finalized in October. Stetson Engineering is reviewing the model currently to verify that it is an appropriate and sufficient model for us to use. All are invited to attend the next Economics Working Group meeting October 9 at the PSE office in Mt. Vernon. Participants can request software that allows them to access the model. They can also access it at PSE offices in Bellevue. Participants are to contact Joel Molander at PSE @ 425-463-3603 to schedule time if they want to “play” with the model. DISCUSS/REVISE MEETING SCHEDULE We moved our meetings from the fourth Wednesday to the fourth Tuesday of the month beginning January 2003. PARKING LOT • Members need to describe their roles in terms of decision-making authority in their organizations (this relates to who would be members of the Policy Solution Team). • Define a process for delayed resolution (based on incomplete studies). • Adaptive management: • How can we take into account future technology, knowledge, conditions, resources, weather (global warming), etc.? • How can we balance licensee exposure? • How to enlist recreational users. • Define “project induced.” (Teamlet?) • FERC boundary. • Develop public information protocol.
