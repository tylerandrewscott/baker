Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Page 1 of 4 RRG Final Meeting Notes, January 16, 2007 AGENDA TOPICS 9:30 – 10:00 Welcome, Review Agenda, Notes, Action Items 10:00 – 10:30 Finalize Meeting Norms Quorum Rule 10:30 – 10:45 FERC Update 10:45 – 11:00 Project Boundary Update Implementation Schedule 11:00 – 11:15 Set Agenda, Date, and Location for Next Meeting Evaluate the Meeting AVAILABILITY OF MOUNTLAKE TERRACE MEETING LOCATION It looks like this location will be available for our use until September of this year. We will continue to meet here until that time. A desire was expressed for the new meeting location (for our October 16 meeting) to be south of Everett. CREEL SURVEY Pam distributed a spreadsheet showing a comparison of 2005 and 2006 numbers from opening day of fishing for fish caught at Baker and Shannon. Cary explained that according to the CPUE (fish/angler – hour), 2006 was 2 ½ times as good as 2005. MEETING NORMS We approved the norms as edited at our last meeting and made some additional edits in the areas of: • Meeting Conduct • Meeting Minutes • Team Leader Responsibilities • Meeting Participant Responsibilities The next version of the norms will be sent out to all for review along with these notes. QUORUM RULE Cary walked us through the language regarding meeting quorum in Article 601 (h). He is convening a BRICC teamlet to propose a solution to the quorum rule as defined in this section. Concern was expressed about smaller resource groups being able to conduct business under a strict interpretation of this rule. Perhaps there would be a representative from the Federal Family and one from the State family. The tribes haven’t agreed that one tribe could represent all others. We might be able to use the proxy rule here. Until the teamlet presents their solution to the BRICC and gets approval, all Working Groups will continue to work as the quorum rule doesn’t come into effect until we get the license. Cary will keep us posted. FERC UPDATE Neither the 401 nor the CZMA Consistency Statement has been issued by Ecology. These will be predicated on a Shorelines Permit being issued by the Town of Concrete. The permitting process for Whatcom and Skagit Counties is complete. Cary reported that PSE has a Substantial Development Permit (to cover the powerhouse, fish passage facilities, stress relief ponds, etc.) pending before the Town of Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 RRG Final Meeting Notes, January 16, 2007 Page 2 of 4 Concrete. This is scheduled to be heard/acted on by the middle of February. At that time, Ecology will have everything they need to issue the Costal Zone Consistency and the 401. The draft version of the 401 is currently out for review with comments due by January 19. Cary reported that it seems consistent with discussions we have had. The USFWS is also doing a Biological Opinion by the end of February. Lou Ellyn reported that they are making good progress with this. NMFS timeline for their Biological Opinion is similar. If there is an appeal, things could slow down. PROJECT BOUNDARY FERC gives us 5 years to formalize the project boundary. Cary guesses we are 95% there in terms of boundary descriptions, etc. Once we formalize this, it will be changed to accommodate the properties acquired according to the terms of the license. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE Pam is working on drafting working plans by task and sub task, team members and timeline for each of the articles along with tentative date schedules. These should be ready for distribution at out next meeting. She is using a tentative start date is April of 2007. She will put these into a Gantt chart assuming an April license issuance. We have 1-2 years to file each plan. This will be helpful in planning our time together.
