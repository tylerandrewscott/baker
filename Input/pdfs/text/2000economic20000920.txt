DEBRIEF OF TOUR The team did their tour on August 9, 2000. It was a small group. It was a helpful tour. The team leader distributed a sign-up sheet for those who were unable to attend the tour. A make-up tour may be planned for those still interested. There may be an opportunity to tour the Lower Baker powerhouse during a planned outage in January or February 2001.  PSE PRESENTATION Ed thanked the group for their energy and participation over the last few months. Joel gave an overview of how investor owned utilities operate. Ed concluded the presentation by discussing the idea of collaboration. He recommended the following article:  "Collaborative Processes for Improving Land Stewardship and Sustainability" by Mark Hummel and Bruce Freet  Pending copyright issues, PSE will make copies of the article to distribute at the October meeting.
