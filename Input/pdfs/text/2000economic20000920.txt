DEBRIEF OF TOUR The team did their tour on August 9, 2000. It was a small group. It was a helpful tour. The team leader distributed a sign-up sheet for those who were unable to attend the tour. A make-up tour may be planned for those still interested. There may be an opportunity to tour the Lower Baker powerhouse during a planned outage in January or February 2001. PSE PRESENTATION Ed thanked the group for their energy and participation over the last few months. Joel gave an overview of how investor owned utilities operate. Ed concluded the presentation by discussing the idea of collaboration. He recommended the following article: “Collaborative Processes for Improving Land Stewardship and Sustainability” by Mark Hummel and Bruce Freet Pending copyright issues, PSE will make copies of the article to distribute at the October meeting. Ed also shared PSE’s interests. He stressed his support of the collaborative process and asked team members to give him a call at any time if they have questions. His direct number is 425-462-3022. Handouts of the presentation were distributed and will be available on the website.
