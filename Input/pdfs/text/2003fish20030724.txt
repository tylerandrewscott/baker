Nick asked the group to review the minutes and submit comments via Livelink to capture them in the record. New Business Gary Sprague raised the question about when/how this group will consider the destressing ponds and acclimation facilities. How will this be included in the Settlement Agreement? How will PSE get input from the agencies? Is there research that can be gathered and presented to the group? It was suggested that Nick include this item in the long-term schedule and decide how it would be incorporated. FSC Workshop Summary The group reviewed discussions from the Surface Collection Workshop that took place July 23-24, 2003 at Baker Lake Lodge. Interesting concepts that were presented included the effect of turbulence on juvenile migration, different configurations of the entrance module, and a guidenet configuration that includes 30-50 feet of solid material at the top, with the goal of creating a turbulent flownet that creates an attraction flow at the entrance of the FSC. Ray suggested a test of this concept at the existing Gulper, and configuring the net at a sharper angle to create flow fields leading to the gulper. Regarding previous discussions of velocity and acceleration at and through the entrance module, the group agreed not to be bound by the 0.1 fps velocity and 0.1 fps/ft gradient criteria discussed. We could use others, as long as the group agrees. PSE agreed to investigate what types of tests can and should be done on the existing Gulper to test turbulent flow and attraction into the system. Filename: 072403 draft minutes.doc Page 2 of 4 Ed Meyer expressed concern that we should exercise caution in putting too much stock in laboratory tests, when reality in nature can be so different. There are many stimuli in the natural environment that can’t be mimicked in the lab. FSC Capacity Determination – 500/1000 cfs Ray reviewed information in the Surface Collection Technology memo as it relates to passage system capacity relative to Project generating capacity. In most cases of existing surface collection technology, flow through the collector is 3-10% of Project flow. PSE has modified its original proposal to start at 250 cfs and has agreed with the agencies’ position to start at 500 cfs, with the capacity to test to 1,000 cfs in phase 1 of the project (500 cfs is 10% of project flow). The group agreed that fish attraction involves more than flow. Location and entrance design/conditions are also significant. Data from the 2002 acoustic tagging study indicate that the location of the current FSC is good. It also appears that increased FSC capacity would increase collection effectiveness. Discussions of additional testing (5-10 years) concluded that while additional data would be provided, it was uncertain that it would be beneficial to the decision-making process. Ed Meyer commented that he does not want to delay the schedule to gather more data and information, unless the group can all agree that it would be beneficial, and not a waste of time. The issue of initial FSC capacity being unresolved, the group began discussions to resolve the issue, but soon tabled them due to the absence of key agency representatives. The BAG agreed to talk by conference call by the end of July to agree on their position regarding starting flow for the surface collectors. Performance standards and settlement agreement article development There have been recent discussions regarding the wisdom of building structures based on data in order to minimize “fits and starts”, saving time in the long run. Cary asked for feedback regarding PSE’s emphasis of recent efforts to stick to the aggressive schedule versus collecting more data to influence the design of what we build. The general consensus seems to be that we want to use the best available data to build the best FSC we can, as quickly as possible. We would then “tweak” it to meet the performance standards, a process that would be continuous throughout the life of the facility. It was agreed that PSE would incorporate check points/flexibility into the wording of the settlement agreement to allow for appropriate decision-making throughout the process. Discussions regarding performance criteria versus prescription criteria ensued, with agreement that some sort of post-construction functional testing would be required. Ed Meyer will follow up with Steve Fransen and others at NMFS whether biological testing of the screens would be required if PSE builds the screens to criteria. If PSE build screens to criteria, there should be shared responsibility between the agencies and PSE. Cary reviewed the three testing elements that PSE developed in response to the BAG performance standards memo. The BRCC will oversee all aspects of standards, methods, and implementation. The testing elements are: 1. Collection survival 2. Collection efficiency 3. Reservoir survival Schedule overview & technical design mtgs. agenda Nick reviewed the upcoming technical design meetings and the long-term schedule. Livelink Meeting Zone demonstration Filename: 072403 draft minutes.doc Page 3 of 4 The Meeting Zone demo was postponed to the Aug. 19 and 20 meetings because there was insufficient data/phone connectivity in the meeting room. Other Issues Nick proposed to schedule site visits for the group to see other surface collectors. The suggested facilities included: White River (during de-watered phase, prior to Aug. 15) Bonneville Lower Granite Rocky Reach Wells Green Peter Grand Coulee Cowlitz Falls Cowlitz Hatchery Mayfield Meeting Evaluation & Assignments Review The group elected to forego the opportunity to evaluate the meeting.
