We added: • Resources to Protect: Wildlife (including mountain goats which are considered sacred to the SaukSuattle. Scott noted that all wildlife including also elk, deer, and bears are considered sacred to the Upper Skagit Tribe. • Plan Development: Monitoring in the future (comprehensive). • Resources to Protect: Preservation of historic properties. • Treaty resources: On USFS lands interested in protecting/enhancing these. • Cultural associations with wildlife, fish, vegetation (Scott would like to define more for the group). • Organize to explain how we’re different and how what we do fits in with other working groups. • Effects of reservoirs: Chemical alterations (saturation, etc.), physical displacement/transportation, erosion an deposition, physical alteration (water wear) of artifacts (dependent on material type), seasonal access to cultural sites, changing the defining features or characteristics of historic places and TCPs • Impacts: TCP introduces a whole range of impacts we can’t capture at this point (awaiting survey results) e.g., sites whose values include solitude- recreationists, etc. could disturb. • Vision site- changes in view shed • Hot springs - increase in visitors (example of impacts to culturally-important areas).
