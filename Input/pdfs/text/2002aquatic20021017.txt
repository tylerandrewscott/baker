Where you wish to record an off-line conversation you had with someone re: this relicensing process, use this form to capture salient points and route it around to everyone who participated in the discussion and once they have all approved it, send the form to Connie Freeland. She will put it in the Public Document Room. This form will be put on the website in the near future. REVIEW LICENSE SCHEDULE Arnie distributed a single summary sheet of the relicensing schedule and the schedule for aquatics studies. He will update the schedule to include the FERC meetings at the end of the month. There will be a meeting to discuss schedule and process for Section 18 and ESA at the Forest Service Building in Mountlake Terrace from 9-3 and the 31st at the Department of Ecology in Bellevue to discuss process and schedule for 401 Water Quality Certification and CZMA. Arnie posted the detailed Graphic representation of the schedule for all to review. FISH PASSAGE TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP REPORT: 2003 DOWNSTREAM FISH STUDIES Nick reported that the Technical Working Group met on Oct. 8 and reviewed study results to date. They will meet again on Nov. 5. They will be going on a field trip to see the Howard Hanson model at ENSR in (Redmond) on Dec.11. The PIT tag and the kelt radio telemetry studies are yielding preliminary results. REPORT FROM INSTREAM FLOWS TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP See A9 in matrix below.

Removed from list of studies we will address. Tabled for now. Awaiting results of A14a. Jenny (AESI ) reported that the aim of this study is to document existing erosion and deposition features along Baker and Shannon shorelines. They are also working on how to estimate annual bank retreat. (Acreage lost for high and severe areas.) They started by doing a remote sensing analysis – were surprised to find that not much geologic mapping had been done. Field inventory was conducted at the reconnaissance level. She had 3 days to do Shannon (at levels between 422-424) and 5 days to do Baker (at levels between 680-692). She noted several landslides. She discussed the maps that she included in the handouts. Hoping to complete this work by December. Members were asked to provide input to Jenny on the mapping. ACTIVE Currently doing field work to support this study. Put in eight transects and 5 scour monitors, and surveyed thalweg profiles in the Delta Left and Delta Right distributary channels. Lost all the scour monitors in the first week. Data gathered this year will be useful for isolating the effects in the drawdown zone since flows have remained steady this fall. Sue discussed the proposed approach with Devin Smith of the SSC. Sue and Devin will also be meeting with the ACOE (re: Little Baker project) next week to discuss linkages between the two studies and coordinating work efforts. Next step will be development of a study plan Study request pending from USFS. This is related to A36. Brady is in the process of re-working it. Merged into A01a and A01b. ACTIVE. This study has been combined with A26. Phil reported that they are using three different methodologies to gain an understanding of the amount of woody debris coming in, where it goes, and how much might be expected over the term of the license. The first method is using 9 photo sets from 1940-1999 to extrapolate the average amount of LWD in the system over time. The second method involves talking with operators and others with knowledge of the amount of wood coming in over the years and how it has been managed. The third method being used 4 of 10   A21 Skagit Wild & Scenic River Values A22 Baker Lake Trout Impacts Evaluation  A23  Baker River Wild & Scenic River Values A24 Hydrologic and Geomorphic Analysis A25 Unnatural Predation  A26A Reservoir Limnology-Production Potential  A26B Tributary Production Potential  A27 Middle Skagit Incubation Flows Baker River Project Relicense Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 10-17-2002; Lyn Wiltse  involves integrating a Canadian model with a model we have developed to help us predict future LWD based on such attributes such as slope, shoreline retreat, tributary widths, etc. ACTIVE This is being addressed by A9 and A24. No longer necessary due to change in management direction in favor of cancellation of non-native trout stocking in the reservoirs. Removed from list of studies we will consider. This is being addressed through A15. ACTIVE Nick discussed the study plan with Stan and incorporated his feedback into the study plan. Work on this will start in mid January. The primary focus will be predation at collection and release points. Nick talked with Brady, Stan, Gary and Phil. They came up with a consensus to send this to a new consultant. The scale data is still being entered – will be ready by end of September so we are running two weeks late from the original schedule. All other data are ready to go. Nick is putting together a list of possible consultants for Stan and Gary to review. We should know who the consultant is by our October meeting. Emily discussed outline: (1) General Calculation, (2) Suitable Habitat in Tributaries for Smolt Production Defined by Spawning and Rearing Distributions and (3) Example Comparison of Available Smolt Production Potential Model Estimates Using Consistent Assumptions of Suitable Habitat. We agreed that 5.5m would be the dividing line between large and small streams. We will look at different life histories for char. Stream gradient categories which are consistent with SSHIAP: 0-1%, 1-2%, 2-4%, 48%, 8-20% and >20%. Less than 3-4% typically have pool-riffle or plane-bed morphologies. Between 4-8% typically have step-pool morphology. Greater than 68% are typically cascades. Production potentials for every species except native char will be decreased by half for each species in glacial streams in comparison to estimates for non-glacial streams. Increased density estimates of coho and cutthroat will be used for ponded habitat. Addressed in A9. 5 of 10   A28 Fish Passage-Reservoir Management  This is being developed in the Fish Passage Technical Working Group. ACTIVE A29 Estimate Sockeye Production from We are still awaiting comments on the Study Request. Different Incubation Sources Nick will meet with Stan to discuss.

R-A36 Native & Wild Inland Fish Population Mark incorporated feedback from Brady and Dean on Assessments this (USFS). The main focus of this study is to compile existing data and do some genetic sampling to determine the genetic makeup of Rainbow trout in Baker Lake. This study would address a conservation issue (protection/support of native species) as well as recreation. There is an opportunity to piggyback onto the genetic research being conducted by Seattle City Light for rainbow stocks elsewhere in the Skagit basin. Mark is the keeper of those samples and is willing to hold them until we have obtained our samples so they could be run together. Many expressed concern that we would be able to get the 100 samples requested to conduct the genetic profile. After considerable discussion, we agreed to have Mark continue to flesh out the details of this in the form of a study plan. Might we consider a phased approach? All agreed that, where possible, we would take advantage of collection efforts in other studies. We will discuss this further at our November meeting to determine next steps. R-A37 Without Project Alternative (evaluation Focus of this is to try to quantify aquatic habitats that of Aquatic & Riparian Habitat) were historically available in the Baker River Basin. The historical analysis will help us to assess future potential of the Basin in the Without Project condition. Sue and Phil met with Brady, Stan, Gary Baker River Project Relicense Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 10-17-2002; Lyn Wiltse  6 of 10   R-A38 Bull Trout Population Assessment & Risk Analysis  and PSE (incl. Tony Fuchs, team leader of the terrestrial working group), as this ties to T7b. Sue discussed 3 tasks: (1) Classify and map historic aquatic habitats to determine future potential habitats. (2) Define project removal approach. (3) Make predictions regarding future conditions based on 1 and 2. What would channel recovery look like over time (10 year increments) 40 or 50 years? We won’t be able to predict future conditions without making assumptions regarding how the project would be removed. We need to make similar assumptions here across all resource working groups so there will be a consistent approach/description for the NEPA analysis. Action Items: • Need to make assumptions regarding historic ecosystems. • Complete mapping of historic habitats. Use same gradient breaks as for A26. Include off channel habitats (wetlands, etc.). • Define approach to get to Without Project condition – will contact Elwa folks, etc. The idea is to enlist participation of someone experienced in this arena to join our effort. It is not to do a detailed analysis of every possible scenario of dam removal. We will include Louis-Berger who is the EA contractor hired by PSE to do the NEPA analysis. When we have looked at outcomes from dam removal, incremental vs. “blow and go”, we will get endorsement from the solution team before proceeding. After a grueling discussion we agreed to discuss this further at our Nov. meeting. New study request submitted by Mark Downen, WDFW. Mark asked for a review and for discussion at the November meeting.  HYDROPS MODEL DEMONSTRATION Bob gave a HYDROPS model demo and discussed with the group how they might run various scenarios through the model. He also explained the process the Economics Working Group is using to establish a hydrological baseline for wet, average, and dry years. He asked for feedback on sample representative years, where the power costs were equal. INTERIM PROTECTION PLAN  Baker River Project Relicense Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 10-17-2002; Lyn Wiltse  7 of 10   After some discussion the group came to the conclusion that if there is no change, we will check in via conference call at month end. In the meantime, PSE will pulse for 4 hours from 7:00am – 11:00am. LITTLE BAKER RIVER RESTORATION PROJECT Arn Thoreen gave a powerpoint presentation of the proposed Skagit Fisheries Enhancement Group Project to restore the Little Baker River distributary channel. The proposed project is sponsored by the Town of Concrete with assistance and feasibility funding from the Army Corps of Engineers. The proposal to restore water from the Lower Baker River through the site of the relic distributary channel would add over a mile of channel with areas for chinook and steelhead spawning and incubation and juvenile rearing, adult spawning viewing structure for the public and downstream acclimation pond and refuge. REPORT ON OLD ACTION ITEMS • Ruth: Talked with Len Barson re: this assignment. Len will bring a draft Interest statements and accompanying issues for the Nature Conservancy to the October 30 Solution Team Meeting. • Rod: Sent copy of paper to Phil. • Lyn: Called Mark Downen and invited him to attend our meetings. He attended and we appreciate it! • Nick: Set up the HYDROPS model demonstration at the Lodge for our meeting. • Arnie: Sent expense reimbursement form to Dick Raisler. • Arnie: Brought Contact Log form sample to October meeting.
