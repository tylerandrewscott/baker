REVIEW RELICENSE SCHEDULE There were no substantive changes to the schedule since our last meeting. We are on the critical path. Time is of the essence and FERC has announced that they won't be granting extensions.  SETTLEMENT PROCESS <ad> UPDATE At the cross-resource workshop last week, we learned that FERC is requiring us to submit the Settlement Agreement along with the license application on April 30, 2004. They are talking no extensions.  We will do a retreat at the Baker Lodge, April 1 and 2 to work on creating a second draft of proposed actions. The aim of this retreat would be: fleshing out the details of proposed actions that are a high priority for evaluation in the PDEA. This would include identifying a range of alternatives that would meet the interest of Working Group members. It would also be helpful to note areas of potentially high agreement along the way (at least areas where there doesn't appear to be a lot of conflict).  We would leave with a prioritized list of areas to address/conflicts to work through. Materials and Supplies for Retreat: <b7> Input from other Working Groups <b7> GIS maps <b7> A37 maps <b7> Study results <b7> Photos <b7> HYDROPS model and output form model <b7> Projector and electronic version of draft proposed actions  DRAFT AGENDAS FOR BAKER LODGE RETREAT  Baker River Project Relicense Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 3-13-03_Final_fishWG_notes.doc; Lyn Wiltse  3 of 10   April 1, 2003 8:30-9:00 Arrive/Get settled/Continental breakfast 9:00-11:00 Finish walking through draft proposed actions 11:00- 11:15 BREAK 11:15-12:15 HYDROPS runs/output/discussion Instream Flows <ad> Update on A9a Ramping, cycling, amplitude Identify additional model runs? 12:15-1:00 LUNCH 1:00-3:00 Complete HYDROPS discussions 3:00-3:15 BREAK 3:15-4:15 Connectivity (IntraBasin movement) 4:15-5:15 Water Quality- Stream and Reservoir 5:15-6:15 p.m. DINNER (with PDB) 7:00-8:30 p.m. Continue Water Quality discussions  April 2, 2003 7:30-8:00 Hot Breakfast 8:00-9:30 Fish Propagation 9:30 <ad> noon Downstream Fish Passage 12-12:45 LUNCH 1:00-3:00 Habitat- Large Woody Debris/Sediment  INSTREAM FLOWS UPDATE (A-9) R2 reports they should have A9c report done in next week (A09a field work may supercede deadline). Will try to get A9d out by March 24. Phil is in the field now, waiting for flows to come down so he can get the remaining transect data over the weekend.  FISH PASSAGE TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP REPORT The group is continuing to rank various options according to set criteria. There is a high degree of uncertainty about the biological implications of the current system and various alternatives being considered. The potential cost exposure is also very high (from $20 Million to $220 Million) Our Settlement Agreement could contain performance standards along with a process to achieve them. Absent a Settlement Agreement, we would have prescriptions that speak only to facilities. They will meet next week to continue discussions.  UPDATE FROM SOLUTION TEAM The Solution Team spent most of their meeting discussing a draft outline of what our settlement agreement process might look like. They also reviewed the goals of the cross-resource workshop March 4-6. During the FERC conference call, the issues of schedule (no extensions granted) and flood control were raised.

Sue will try to see that we get to see this before our April 1 and 2 retreat. She will bring GIS maps to the retreat. See report for 101.A. ACTIVE See report for 101.A. ACTIVE Sue reported that this existing conditions report will be out before the end of the month. Not discussed. No action yet. PSE will review existing information for the PDEA. Not discussed. Last meeting Phil reported that they downloaded pressure sensors last and are still in the process of collecting data. Links to A9. ACTIVE Not discussed. Data collection underway as per Study Plan. This study will be ongoing through Spring, 2004. Hoping to have all requirements fulfilled for Water Quality Certification. Complete. Complete. Complete. Sue reported that Phil is currently out in the field waiting for flows to subside so he can try to get the rest of the transect data we are missing. We will get an update at our April retreat. Not discussed. Adam is researching what type of spike in flow over what window of time is required to influence spawning behavior. R2 will continue to look at this when PSE resumes a regular operating schedule. Not discussed. PDEA contractors have requested a description of life history and timing of spawning for all species. These data will be out prior to our March meeting for discussion. (we are expecting draft report for distribution by April 1) Not discussed. After our January meeting, Phil got 2001 and 2002 WDFW Mt. Vernon screw trap data. They are integrating this into a report to be out in the next couple of weeks (including scoop trap and Baker trap data). Complete. Note: USFWS is concerned with impacts to char and indirectly to bald eagles through chum and also to cutthroat. Tie to A26. Split between R-A21 & R-A09. Not discussed.

Greta reported the USFS will pursue this in the recreation working group. Removed from list of studies we will address. Tabled for now. Awaiting results of A14a. Arnie reported that the draft report for this will be out in the next week so we have time to review it prior to our April 1 meeting. (we are expecting draft report by April 1) Not discussed. Field work is complete. Hope to have the report in March 2003. Sue and Devin Smith of SSC met with folks working on the Little Baker Side Channel Restoration Project to identify synergies. By April 10, she'll get us a draft of the Study Plan including potential PME alternatives and a description of what type of analysis we'll be doing for each and what outputs we might expect. We agreed that as a first step, we could use existing GIS maps to get at resident trout habitat. A37 will include what trout production would be without the project. We could extend it to have Asit do some analysis of existing reservoir production potential of resident trout. This means doing steps 1-7, and 9 now (according to the March 11 handout from R2: Effects of the Baker River Project on Resident Trout Potential Analysis Procedure). Based upon these data we could discuss what next steps are appropriate for the future. Brady appreciates R2's effort on this.. Merged into A01a and A01b. ACTIVE. This study has been combined with A26. Sue asked members to review suggestions in Phil's cover letter for discussions at the April 1, 2 retreat. This is being addressed by A9 and A24. No longer necessary due to change in management direction in favor of cancellation of non-native trout stocking in the reservoirs. Removed from list of studies we will consider. This is being addressed through A15. Sue distributed the Hydrology (IHA) portion of this report. It compares current project operations with unregulated flows. This is an effects analysis. It is not predictive. This provides a good place to start 6 of 10   A25 Unnatural Predation A26A Reservoir Limnology-Production Potential A26B Tributary Production Potential A27 Middle Skagit Incubation Flows A28 Fish Passage-Reservoir Management A29 Estimate Sockeye Production from Different Incubation Sources R-A30 Near-Field Smolt Behavior R-A31 Fish Passage-Far Field Smolt Migration R-A32 Fish Passage-Kelt Radio telemetry R-A33 Fish Passage-PIT Tag Migration  identifying what we might want to explore through the HYDROPS model. We can assess various HYDROPS using the IHA model to compare various alternatives. Note: Time periods and parameters are flexible. Let Sue know if you want to see something else to run through the IHA model. This report will be shared with the Economic Working Group, the County, etc. Please give your comments to Sue by the end of April, 2003. Part 2 of this report.- Sediment Transport and Channel Response will be out by end of April. Nick reported that we are currently investigating unnatural opportunities for predation in four sites. Ten samplings have been completed of fry releases (March-May is the time frame for these releases). These samplings are taken every four days through out the time frame. We are also sampling smolt migration. This study is being combined with resident trout and bull trout surveys. We are fin clipping everything but the sculpin. It looks like a few sculpin will have to be sacrificed. The draft report is due out by the end of March. The Water Quality analysis is complete. Some data (phytoplankton) gaps have been identified. This will be reflected in the reports along with specific recommendations for future studies (may need to be included in adaptive management). Results combined in the report for A01a and A01b and expected by the April 10 meeting. Addressed in A9. Now addressed in Fish Passage Studies A30 to A34. ACTIVE This year, we have sockeye emerging out of Beach 3 and 4. For now, we have agreed to collect and preserve 100 samples. We can determine what to do with them latter on (otolith analysis).

As part of the bull trout and resident trout studies, we are taking tissue samples. We will also be taking samples from the fish traps. Nick will follow up with Mark re: the number of samples needed. Tissue sampling continues... Sue walked us through a presentation of the where we are with this study. The emphasis was using data on historic aquatic habits to predict future potential aquatic habitats. It also provides a semiquantitative description of aquatic habitats that would be present under various future operating scenarios: ongoing operations, dam decommissioning, and ongoing flood control without project. Members seemed reasonably comfortable with the assumptions as introduced that R2 is making for this study. She will bring tables/maps to our April 1st. This is underway. We will discuss April 10th. . Phil prepared a paper on what species are in the Baker River Project basin and what their habitat is. We will look at linking this to A1, 2, 9, 15, 16, 24, 37, 17, 26b and fish passage. Sue and Phil will follow up with Ruth on how to handle this.
