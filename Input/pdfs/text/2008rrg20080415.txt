Pam: Look into setting up design review meeting of LB Adult Fish Trap Design with interested parties from Town of Concrete. Brian: Is the easement for Lake Shannon considered a completed ROW? What is the exact location? Give us an update on easement for Lake Shannon at our June meeting. Check with Steven Falquest on this.

Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 RRG Final Meeting Notes, February 19, 2008  Page 1 of 4   SPOTTED OWLS AND MARBLED MURRELETS Dave found some past surveys (about 20 years old) for Marbled Murrelet, Spotted Owl. The surveys sight some near the campground – 3/4 to 1 mile. The surveys are about 20 years old. WDFW has requested two years of surveying prior to construction. This request has been made of USFWS and the RRG. The USFS is currently setting up a field review with USFWS for their project and others in the Basin. It will include, at a minimum, Marbled Murrelet and Spotted Owl. FSC Field Trip The FSC field trip will be June 10. It will include interested members of all the Baker relicense working groups including the BRICC. All are to let Pam know by May 22 if they want to be on the list to attend. BAKER LAKE RESORT Pam reported that she, Ann and Jamie Van De Vanter are working on developing a site plan. The cost estimate is nearly complete. It should be ready for a 50% review at our June meeting. Ann reported that they might be meeting with USFWS on May 13. We’ll get an update on this also at our June meeting. Appreciation was expressed for the detailed land survey PSE conducted in August of 2007. It included all trees larger than 8” in diameter. Pam reported there should be little to no impact on trees. There will be a review point of this for the RRG at our June meeting. Pam announced that Haley Edwards will be doing some high-level recon of the area in the next few days, paying close attention to specific Marbeled Murrelet habitat. She will note any Marbled Murrelet sightings. WDFW is concerned with timing and noise impacts to Marbled Murrelet and Spotted Owls. FERC/BRICC Update Steve Fransen reported on April 11 that the NMFS Biological Opinion is currently undergoing simultaneous review by legal and his manager. He expects this review to be complete within the next few days. Once FERC receives the Bi-Op and determines that the terms are consistent with what was issued before, they should be ready to go with issuing the license in fairly short order. There is still an outstanding issue with Diking District 17. They need to withdraw their protest to the license (as we expect them to do) or it will become a contested proceeding. This would delay the process by approximately 2 months. Cary suggested that if the license isn’t out by July it will probably not be out until September or later. The BRICC will meet again on June 10 following the FSC field trip. NW Hydro Association Recreation Public Safety Workshop Pam walked us through her notes from this workshop held in Portland on February 21. Pam has found that our public safety plan is currently included in the Dam Safety Plan required by FERC and reviewed during Safety Inspections every 5 years. We will need to work out liability issues with the Forest Service. Pam also walked us through the new FERC Form 80. She reported that her recreation staff is prepared to do data collection through observation and visitor surveys at Project sites (access areas, visitor center, etc.). Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 RRG Final Meeting Notes, April 15, 2008  Page 2 of 4   There was also an interesting discussion at the conference on law enforcement. We’ve received feedback from campers that they very much appreciate the extra law enforcement presence we have been providing the last 5 years. Lower Baker Adult Fish Trap With our feedback the visitors’ platform has been moved more toward the middle of the pond to afford a better view. Cary explained that much of the trap is inside buildings. We are looking at setting up some additional viewing areas. Some aspects of the original trap have been preserved and incorporated into the new trap. We will help make sure that I&E includes more than a cultural/historical component. The danger of doing this late in the process is it may not be well facilitated. We are looking at adding interpretive kiosks and old actuators around the walkway to provide additional I&E experience. If we are limited in what we can do with the actual trap, we can change the visitor area to match the more modern looking new Visitor Center which will be next door. Cary suggested that we will have a good opportunity to do this after the new Visitor Center is constructed and we are doing landscaping around it. We want to consider the difference between the look of a public space and the look of a project facility – these don’t necessarily have to be the same. Historic photos would be appreciated as they provide context and honor the past. People also seem to enjoy statistics around fish species and timing of various runs: How much and how big. There is always value in bringing in cultural connections – tribal, historical, ties to people from Concrete. We could also include how salmon fit into the whole food web and focus on the species for this particular system. Also tell the story of hydro power. There are also opportunities for art. There will be a video showing original fish operations. There will be various cameras mounted on walls to show various stages of the fish crowding and handling and there will be a stream/continuous loop fed to the Visitor’s Center. We also have to balance safety and security issues. The design has been reviewed and approved by the CRAG. The color gray has been selected to match the color of the original historical structure. They may also do some texturing and/or seasoning of the look of the surface of the structures. Siding and roofing is set to be galvanized corrugated steel (at the recommendation of the CRAG) in order to preserve the industrial look. We discussed ways to perhaps minimize the impression of the massiveness of the facility. Ideas included darkening the color, using different shades of grey, adding windows (fake or otherwise), building a porch around the door, adding a fake eave to break up the height, and adding vegetation where possible. Bright white PVC pipes should be painted a darker color, adding shrubbery. We also suggested expanding the walkway from 4 foot to 5 foot to minimize the tunnel like appearance. People don’t like to walk into tunnels. Construction will begin in June. The contractor is putting his final price together by the end of April. Toni will get us samples of building materials for review. She will also discuss our suggestions with members of the CRAG.
