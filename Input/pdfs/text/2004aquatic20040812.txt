FISH PASSAGE TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP REPORT Arnie reported that they are continuing to meet re: Upper Baker Floating Surface Collector (FSC) design. They will begin construction in Fall of 2005 to be operational by April of 2007. Currently, they are working on the physical model of the FSC and this week witnessed the 1st test of the model in the dry and at simulated flow conditions. They are also developing the reservoir forebay hydraulic model (CFD model) that will describe the forebay flow circulation patterns simulated under several scenarios of pool elevations. Frequent meetings will take place on these topics, to witness and test the physical model (and modifications to it) and simulate runs and present results on the CFD model, between now and the end of October 2004. Some design changes have caused the modeling schedule to slip a bit. The bulk of the FSC design work will continue through Spring of 2005. The permitting process for the FSC construction and launch site is about to begin. The planning process for this is nearly complete. Note: The August 12th Fish Passage meeting has been cancelled because of a conflict with a Legal Team Meeting. SETTLEMENT PROCESS UPDATE Lyn reported on the current schedule of Legal Working Group meetings and the agenda for the next Policy Team/Legal Working Group combined meeting scheduled at Embassy Suites in Lynnwood from 9:00 to 3:00 on Sept. 19. The draft aquatics license articles were sent out Aug. 3 for review. The first Legal Group review of the draft aquatics license articles occurred Aug. 11. All comments are due Aug. 13. The next meeting to continue the legal review of the wording will occur on Aug. 17. We are definitely on the critical path of an extremely aggressive schedule. The turnaround times for license article review are extremely tight. We are getting excellent participation at the attorney meetings and are on track for submitting the Settlement Agreement to FERC by the end of September. Note: The Policy team meeting on September 22 will be a signing meeting. See page one of these notes for the schedule of August meeting dates and topics. INSTREAM FLOW TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP REPORT At the June 24 meeting, the consensus was to go with the SNF.06 flow scenario. Since then, Phil reported that they have cleaned up the eRoom files. He is working on an Instream Flow Summary Report to document the decision making process with supporting data. He anticipates getting this report out by the end of the year. Phil reported that Stuart Beck-R2 completed the alevin analysis. He distributed handouts illustrating the alevin analysis for PSE.01, FS.03b, SNF.06, and PSE.21. After reviewing the data, the group has increased confidence in our new flow regime with the minimum flow of 1200 cfs. In summary, there was not much difference between the assumption of a two-day low flow for egg dewatering vs. a one hour low flow for alevin dewatering. Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Aquatics Resources Working Group, August 12, 2004 Page 3 of 6   SKAGIT COUNTY UPDATE ON FLOOD CONTROL Jeff distributed a draft document: Skagit County's commitment to Stewardship. He welcomes comments, preferably by the end of August. Janne Keje of Steward and Associates walked us through a PowerPoint presentation: Environmental Effects of Additional Flood Control in the Baker River. Both positive and negative effects were analyzed. This analysis was fairly high level and did not take into account the impacts of the PMEs that have been agreed to include in the settlement agreement including the proposed flow regime of SNF.06. The report reviewed reservoir effects of additional flood control as well as downstream effects of additional flood control. Conclusions listed in the Report: <b7> Early drawdown of reservoirs (completed prior to peak spawning) should minimize redddewatering in the drawdown-affected portions of tributaries and spawning areas along the shoreline. <b7> Additional drawdown during early fall will expose several miles of tributary habitat that are currently inundated and of little value to spawning salmon, but provide spawning habitat while in a free-flowing state. <b7> No evidence to suggest that reservoir volume (rearing capacity) or zooplankton production (food supply) is limiting fish production. <b7> Turbidity concerns seem not well founded. <b7> Early fall drawdown may decrease the incidence of wind-induced wave erosion of vegetated shorelines during fall storms. <b7> Amphibians should not be adversely impacted. <b7> Additional flood control will provide clear benefits by reducing frequency and magnitude of scour events. <b7> Increased water releases during the fall (due to drawdown) may induce fall spawning species to spawn higher along channel margins. <b7> Based on modeling studies, the effect of fall flows on redd de-watering is tenuous at best. <b7> Chinook face the lowest risk of dewatering due to its spawning habitat preferences, but is strongly impacted by scour. <b7> There is more than enough water available to augment flows during dry periods to minimize or eliminate serious dewatering incidents. <b7> Additional flood protection, while reducing flood peaks, will not eliminate or appreciably reduce channel maintenance flows. Phil noted that a key piece missing from this report is an answer to the question: What are the effects of adding 1000 cfs average daily flow to the Skagit River between September 10 and October 15 (during peak spawning period)? The effects of early fall reservoir drawdown should be reviewed in terms of reservoir production and downstream effects. Mike gave a quick update on the status of flood control discussions between Skagit County and PSE. Mike explained that one of the Additional Information Requests PSE received from FERC was to submit the flood control study commissioned by Skagit County. The plan is to get this report to PSE by August 20 so they can get it to FERC by Aug. 30. When this report is out is will be distributed to ARWG members. Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Aquatics Resources Working Group, August 12, 2004 Page 4 of 6   130<ad>140K acre feet seems to be a range that keeps popping up. Skagit Co. will be proposing the highest flood storage levels possible that are economical. Average annual flood damage is $54 million (according to the ACOE methodologies). Additional flood control will reduce that number by about $10 million a year. Steve suggested that flood control has always been a difficult fit into the relicensing process, as it has never been linked to project effects. He further suggested that the list of the County actions listed in the Stewardship paper is not balanced in that it mentions none of the actions taken by the County that actually resulted in degrading the environment. Mike noted that FERC recognizes that flood control is an accepted project purpose as shown by the additional information request for Skagit County's Flood Control Study. STUDY UPDATES A02: Lower Baker River Habitat & Fish Use The draft report was out in May. No comments have been received. We agreed to post this as draft Final on the website.
