Tony & Mike Mueller – Continue to pursue early acquisition issues … timber and Crown Pacific lands Tony – book room for March 7th meeting and send meeting confirmation to Teamlet members LAND ACQUISITION UPDATE Tony reviewed our land acquisition activities to date; there was nothing new to report and there will be no additional activities between now and the end of the year. RMEF has hired a new Lands Program Manager for WA & OR; his name is Tom Macy. Tom will be phasing in over the next six months and we will probably be seeing more of him than we did of Mike Mueller because Tom lives closer to us. SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ARTICLES / ISSUES Tony walked the group through an overview of the Settlement Agreement, specifically the Elk Article, for the benefit of our WDFW guests. ELK HERD MANAGEMENT PLAN Mike discussed the Washington State Elk Herd Plan – North Cascade (Nooksack) Elk Herd. The concept of core areas vs. peripheral areas is still valid. The Nooksack Herd is quite small compared to other herds. The challenges of working a range that is 20 miles squared are quite different from the challenges of managing larger herds. Core areas in our management plan are away from roads, agriculture, development, etc. The core area is defined as the area where we actively want to encourage the herd. The peripheral areas are lands that we don’t want to lose for elk, but will be more liberally managed. The core area will be transferred onto PSE’s elk cover type map for reference. WDFW’s priority would be for us to acquire land that is within the core area defined for this herd. WDFW has an interest in looking forward in determining elk lands; there is value in promoting a re- establishment of elk in lands beyond the lands the herd is using today. We discussed the value of protecting land that is at greatest risk of development and ensuing that we don’t create ‘islands’ of habitat that get cut off from other lands. The Sauk Game Management Unit area above Concrete, which is currently our third priority area listed in Article 503, would garner a higher priority in WDFW’s assessment, because it parallels the core area in terms of being an area that is very capable of wintering animals. The advantage of that area as a potential Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Elk Teamlet Meeting Notes, December 20, 2005 Page 2 of 4 alternate is that it doesn’t have high housing development or extensive farmlands. It compares to other areas that have been identified. The Burpee Hill area comes with potential management conflicts, and areas in the valley bottom would not be as high a priority for WDFW. WDFW defines this area as a peripheral area, as these lands are being developed rapidly and offer no guarantee of future protection ability. We discussed the idea of focusing on the area we identified earlier (minus the Burpee Hill block), and those areas north of the power line. A possible concept of adding a fence (from the cliff near Baker through to Hwy 9) along the power line could solve 20 miles of existing damage issues for WDFW, and would turn peripheral elk area into core area. Fencing is currently costing about $10,000 per mile (material only). This would also keep elk North of and away from the highway and out of the rapidly developing lower valley; WDFW and our Elk Teamlet expressed interest in the continued exploration of this concept. Mike stated that our focus areas, with the modifications discussed earlier (away from Burpee Hill and away from the lower valley river area), are areas that WDFW could support. Purchasing land outside the core Elk area could entail a level of risk if this land is outside WDFW’s ability to manage against damage and/or objectives for animals in those areas. ELK DAMAGE CLAIMS ASSESSMENT Bill walked us through the WDFW Info Packet re: Elk Damage Complaints (see handout), describing examples of typical elk damage complaints. He and Larry discussed elk behavior and WDFW’s damage management activities. The WDFW is interested in pursuing ideas that would support elk while alleviating damage issues. Of note, barbed wire does not pose much of a deterrent to elk; they go through this at will, and often at multiple locations. OTHER: The group discussed the recreation uses of PSE acquired lands. WDFW has a variety of options for managing public access/use of elk lands. WDFW emphasized the importance of balancing multi-use recreation activities on acquired elk lands including hunting and public viewing. All expressed appreciation to Lauri for her strong representation to date, and expressed an interest in a continued dialogue between the Elk Teamlet and the larger WDFW group. Tony will add Bill, Mike and Larry to the Elk Teamlet email distribution list. NEXT STEPS: We will keep informed of activity re: timber and Crown Pacific Lands. Our most pressing upcoming focus will be on the DEIS.
