SETTLEMENT PROCESS UPDATE As a result of the cross-resource workshop, we hope to move from first draft PMEs to second draft PMEs. BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 2/25/2003 MEETING NOTES Page 2 Baker Solution Team-Lyn Wiltse, PDSA Consulting, Inc. Facilitator FERC PROJECT NO. 2150 The Facilitator Team suggests the Solution Team review what comes out of the workshop in the form of technical Working Groups by resource area. We will ensure that all resource areas are adequately covered. As needed, the Baker Solution Technical Working Groups would confer with resource area Working Groups for technical advice/support. Concern was expressed about the schedule. Many felt it was premature to try to work on the second draft PMEs with many studies still outstanding and some “un-drafted” PMEs. There were also questions about the timing of starting up some Baker Solution Team technical Working Groups when the regular Working Groups are still working through major issues. We will see what emerges from the workshop and then discuss the settlement process again at our March 25 meeting. CROSS-RESOURCE WORKSHOP People seem to be looking forward to the 2 ½ days. Workshop packets, complete with agendas, have been emailed out. There were no questions re: the format or substance of the workshop. PSE’s DRAFT PROPOSED ACTIONS After some discussions, where fears were expressed that the Solution Team’s request of PSE to come up with a straw man to help move the process forward might actually serve to move the process backward since it doesn’t appear to be collaborative, we decided that any movement was good. Ed distributed PSE’s attempt at a precursor to the second draft PMEs. Hard copies were distributed to those present and will be mailed to absent Solution Team members. Electronic versions (pdf format) will be sent to all Working Group members with an explanatory note. Ed’s cover letter will remain attached when it is distributed to non-Solution Team members (Working Group members). We will discuss the draft proposed actions at the March workshop. QUESTIONS FOR FERC • Absent in-stream flow data, might FERC give us an extension? • Flood Control – What’s the process? FERC CONFERENCE CALL License Extension? No extension can be given, and PSE must file its license application on the due date (April 30, 2004). Any “holes” must be handled through Adaptive Management and/or possibly additional studies. FERC might also issue a Notice of Acceptance and ask for additional information, giving us the summer of 2004 for additional studies. FERC prefers Adaptive Management over additional studies after the application is filed. Crafting Adaptive Management language could allow us to still come up with a Settlement Agreement. BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 2/25/2003 MEETING NOTES Page 3 Baker Solution Team-Lyn Wiltse, PDSA Consulting, Inc. Facilitator FERC PROJECT NO. 2150 Flood Control In the Economics/Operations Working Group, members have accepted the Corp’s flood control requirements as baseline conditions. Dave Brookings announced that Skagit County will be meeting February 26 with PSE and the USACE to discuss study needs around flood control, possibly including a cost sharing agreement. Any change in the volume of the current flood control regime would require approval by Congress. Marian expects that the Corps will ask that the flood control volume (up to 100,000 acre-feet in the current Article 32) remain in the new license. The Corps currently uses 74,000 acre-feet. The federal government reimburses PSE for 58,000 acre-feet. That reimbursement was the result of Congressional action, so any change in that would require approval by Congress. However, within the FERC licensing process, there might be decision space to increase that volume without reimbursement for the additional flood control storage space. There might be some flexibility in the timing of the draw down. There was not consensus on this. Marian will follow up with Wayne Wagner to try to get clarification. We agreed to let the Economics/Operations Working Group continue to wrestle with this issue. We will get a report from them at our March 25 meeting. Scoping Document 2 Steve H. has sent a draft scoping Document 2 to Connie and Rob for review. He will integrate their comments and get the revised draft out for broader review by March 14. REPORT ON OLD ACTION ITEMS • Keith prepared a working paper on flood storage in lieu of convening a teamlet. • All let Keith know if they’d like to participate in the flood control teamlet meeting. • All checked with respective organizations re: single NEPA process. • Steve H. called Steve F. and Rob re: how PDEA can satisfy NMFS requirements (BA). • Steve H. finished up a draft Scoping Document 2 and sent to Connie and Rob for review prior to sending out for Solution Team review. • Steve H. touched base with Kris and Rob re: schedule. • Kris posted the SureTrak Relicensing Schedule on the website. • Bob H. did a great job categorizing our list of meeting norm items for our review. Thanks Bob! PDEA Update May 1st is the date for the first preliminary draft. It will be a snapshot of work in progress. It will include affected environment and be light in many areas absent studies. The Louis Berger Group will be seeking feedback re: tone/organization of this initial draft. Next steps: Get guidance from the Solution Team by June 1st as to what should be used in the PDEA as a preferred alternative. For the September draft, we will need to include costs (lost power output and economic outlays). We will be looking to the Working Groups for help with estimating these costs. After the September PDEA, there will be a call for preliminary terms and conditions from the agencies. There seems to be good cooperation among Louis Berger team members and Working Group members. BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 2/25/2003 MEETING NOTES Page 4 Baker Solution Team-Lyn Wiltse, PDSA Consulting, Inc. Facilitator FERC PROJECT NO. 2150 HYDROPS Update Jon distributed a list of specifications used by USFS and Stetson re: critical pieces to have in the evaluation model. They have had discussions re: model requirements across various stakeholder groups. A number of the responses in the right hand column involve modifications PSE is working with Powel to incorporate into the HYDROPS model. “Model” refers to HYDROPS plus R-2’s Habitat Model. Connections between these two models are critical, because resource effects need to be considered along with economic effects. (The R-2 model needs instream flow data to be complete). There is also streamlining going on to make hard and soft constraints flow more fluidly. The system is also being modified to accommodate multi-year runs. Next step: Final evaluation will happen after modifications to the model have been completed (hoping for end of March). Powel is entering into an agreement with Stetson that will allow Stetson to have a copy of the model on one of Powel’s desk top computers (to be housed at Stetson). WHAT’S HOT IN THE WORKING GROUPS?

In reviewing the overall schedule, between now and April 30, 2004, the timeline for license application, PDEA, and Settlement Agreement are all on the critical path. MEETING NOTES PROTOCOL We reminded everyone of the protocol we have re: Working Group minutes. The initial draft notes will essentially be what comes from the facilitator (grammatical and other small, non-substantive edits from team leaders are fine).

Any substantive edits to that first draft from team leader/others will be italicized in the second draft.
