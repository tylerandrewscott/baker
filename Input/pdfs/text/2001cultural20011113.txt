COLLECTION/CURATION FOLLOW UP BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 11/13/01 MEETING L Wiltse for Cultural and Historic Resources Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 2   Jessie shared an email she received from Karen Marshall of the Skagit County Historical Museum, offering her assistance in understanding curation-related nomenclature. We may consider a visit to her site at an appropriate time in the future. She has graciously offered to give us a tour/talk or whatever meets our needs. CULTURAL RESOURCE TRAINING Pending acceptance of the UDP, Jessie has talked with Gail and Connie about Gail providing PSE with a sensitivity training in January 2002. She would do this with PSE officers, directors, the whole Baker Relicensing Team and other interested folks to underscore the importance of tribal consultation, UDP, etc. We will try to have tribal participation in Gail’s training. Then Gary could follow up with archaeological training (including UDP) for the same folks, and a more detailed (hands-on) version of this training for the people who work up at the plant. We’ll be sure to get their input prior to the training and work to make the training user friendly. Deputy Nelson could follow Gary’s training with ARPA regulations. This training would be for the folks at the plants. Tribal presentations (as done by Larry Campbell) could be folded into the archeological and sensitivity training that Gary provides. He’ll discuss this with the tribes. Janis suggested that the training include protocol re: Who to call, what to do, etc. We need to button up with the Forest Service on these trainings, since Forest Service land is also involved. TCP TRAINING Jessie debriefed us on the National Preservation Institute Traditional Cultural Properties Training in San Francisco. Jessie, Connie, and Ed Schild for PSE attended along with various tribal representatives including Larry Campbell (Swinomish), Jason Joseph (Sauk Suiattle), and Scott Schuyler (Upper Skagit), as well as Gail Thompson and Alex Maass (HRA). . Our “team” had eight members at the training. Connie got feedback re: how amazing it was that we attended as a team (licensee, consultants, and tribal representatives) and that we were all working together and appeared to like each other. (It’s true!) It was also nice to get to know Jason, Scott and Larry better. All appreciated the time to “be” together. Larry reported that he found the training to be very valuable in that many questions were answered and new questions arose as a result. The TCP trainer (Tom King) emphasized that it is not necessary to take an extremely literal approach, since TCP is a very fuzzy concept. “Sacred” is a very difficult concept to define/grasp. It was also pointed out that putting places on the National Register does not necessarily afford them protection. Tom King also stressed that in defining TCPs, we should focus on the spirit rather than the letter of the law – Focus on a solution. Larry sees defining TCPs for tribes as putting up a red flag that would send people to talk to the appropriate people before beginning a project. We have the opportunity to supplement the literature Tom distributed at the training. Janis mentioned that Tom has a second edition of his book out.
