BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 2150 2/12/2003 MEETING NOTES L Wiltse for Economics/Operations Working Group.  Page 2   PLAN FOR MARCH CROSS-RESOURCE WORKSHOP Prior to the Workshop A CD listing all the PMEs that each research Working Group is considering along with a draft agenda for the March Workshop will be out by February 18th. Participants will be asked to fill out a pre-workshop worksheet to consider how to resolve conflicts, etc. PSE will send out their proposal (with elements of Working Group PMEs) for review on Feb. 26. March 4, Tuesday (afternoon only) 1:00-5:00 High level PMEs presentations by a member of each Working Group (Cultural, Terrestrial, Aquatics, Recreation, Economics/Operations) Jerry has graciously accepted our request that he do our presentation. Probable Attendees: Jerry (presenter), Jon, Bob, Gary (not sure when he will arrive), Rod M., Lloyd March 5, Wednesday (all day) Dee will begin with a review of the background of our process to date. She will then do a brief training session on interest-based negotiations to kick things off. Then we will walk through PSE's Proposal, highlighting pieces that have cross-resource implications e.g. the proposed reservoir management regime. Joel Molander of PSE will explain how PSE came up with its reservoir management plan (share outputs from HYDROPs model runs, etc.) Then we will split up into distinct resource areas to: Flag impacts on resource (add conflicts to lists already posted from Feb. Working Group meeting) List how it affects the organizational interests Report back to the larger group Probable Attendees: Jerry, Jon, Bob, Gary, Rod M., Lloyd, Joel March 6, Thursday (all day) Finish PSE Proposal (pieces with cross resource implications) Review other PMEs with cross resource implications Review (amended) list of conflicts Brainstorm to resolve conflicts Review (amended) list of conflicts Brainstorm to optimize synergies Plan next steps Probable Attendees: Jerry, Jon, Bob, Gary, Rod M., Lloyd, Joel After discussing the plan for the three-day workshop, some expressed concern that a "PSE proposal" feels positional rather than collaborative-interest based. Bruce explained the effort he saw by PSE in creating a proposal that pulled the group's PMEs together and addressed the interests of each working group participant. Group concluded great care should be taken to ensure that people understand the background (PME-tie) to what is included in this "straw man." Lloyd pointed out that in the ICD and Scoping documents, PSE stated it would define PSE's proposed action thru collaborative process identifying  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 2150 2/12/2003 MEETING NOTES L Wiltse for Economics/Operations Working Group.  Page 3   desirable changes in the project. This is a first effort in defining group's collective preferred alternative. The process needs to identify quickly proposals for the PDEA.  Jerry will present the Economics/Operations group PME proposals on March 4th. It was also suggested that the each breakout group include members from all resource areas.  PMEs from this group will include 5.01 <ad> CZMA Consistency; 5.02 <ad> Additional flow releases for mitigation of water use; 5.03 Submerged Lands; and 5.06<ad> Flood Control  FERC CALL: (Keith Brooks and Linda Lehman) Keith will draft a preliminary analysis of legal issues surrounding flood control within the context of the Baker River Project Relicensing Process. He will do this by February 19th and send it to all Working Group members for review. Group decided to use the term "flood control" and not "flood management."  Following inserted by Team Leader with review by Dave, Ken and Keith. FERC cannot reduce the current Baker flood control below that specified in the 1977 congressional resolution. In general, specific legislation usually trumps general legislation. The 1977 Corps report 95-149 on Baker flood control report to Congress is clear and precise. Until changed by Congress, the current Corps flood control regime and compensation at Baker is permanent. To change from the current Corps flood control policy, the Corps would conduct appropriate studies and submit a request to Congress to adopt a new regime. [FERC's assessment is that there is not enough time for this in the context of relicensing<ad> it would have to occur after License. Skagit County believes the work can be completed within the relicensing process.] FERC has no jurisdiction over the Corps. FERC can order additional Flood Control Storage beyond the current Corps 74k acre-feet as part of a settlement agreement, provided it is in the public interest and is consistent with resource balancing. The Corps has been responsible for their Baker flood control project's EA/BA. The Corps wrote the initial EA for Baker flood control and in 2000 conducted a BA of Upper Baker, a subsequent study on bull trout was done by USFW and Corps issued a supplement issued in 2001. Puget was not a party to the BA or other studies. PSE is responsible for the projects BA in relicensing except that portion that addresses Corps flood control.  PMEs 5.01 CZMA Consistency. Lloyd distributed the paper Rod Sakrison put together on CZMA consistency. We agreed that this is a very helpful checklist of things we need to do to ensure compliance.  5.02 Additional flow releases for mitigation of water use. Jerry explained that this PME refers to a relatively new regulation adopted by DOE relating to water rights and minimum instream flows for WRIA-3 and WRIA-4 Skagit River. The aim of this PME is to try to mitigate for this regulation which states that water supply could be interrupted. The idea is for PSE to provide additional releases from the Baker River Project when the Skagit River at Mt. Vernon falls below minimum instream flow requirements. This would mitigate for the amount of water taken out of the system that is subject to this regulation. This would make it possible for folks to have an uninterrupted water supply. The maximum amount we might mitigate for would be 200 cfs.  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 2150 2/12/2003 MEETING NOTES L Wiltse for Economics/Operations Working Group.  Page 4   PSE expressed concern about going forward with this PME (as an enhancement). They questioned the legality of the enhancement: (1) the current regulation specific excludes hydroelectric facilities and (2) no current DOE regulation links consumptive and non-consumptive water rights. These would require changes in DOE regulations. Also the minimum instream flow is set at mere 26% exceedance in critical months. All will review this Study Request and PME for discussion this at our March meeting.  5.03 Submerged Lands. Lloyd will write up a PME addressing the ownership of the original Baker Lake and the Baker River bed.  5.06 Flood Control. Lloyd will write up a PME as a "place holder" reflecting the current License article.  PME's to be included on the February 18th CD for the Economics Working group are: 5.01 <ad> CZMA <ad> Department of Ecology; 5.02 <ad>Flow Augmentation; 5.03 Submerged Lands; and 5.06<ad> Flood Control  STUDY REQUESTS R-01 Additional flow releases for water use mitigation. See the discussion above under PME's. Joel and Lloyd's comments are incorporated as revisions.  R-02 Evaluation of Optimal Flood Control Storage in Upper Baker Reservoir Dave incorporated the comments he received on this. All will review it and be ready to discuss next Steps at our March meeting. We agreed to move this to the Study Plan phase.  R-03 Examination of Spawning and Incubation Flows in the Skagit River below the Baker Confluence during Brood year 2000. This provides an opportunity to study low season flows. This was tabled. Stan will follow up with PSE and we'll discuss how to proceed at out March meeting.  HYDROPS MODEL REPORT Rod Mace reported that about 18 issues have been identified by Stetson Engineering re: the specifications they felt were necessary to do an adequate evaluation. Modifications are being made to the model to address 5 or 6 of those. Most of the remaining points now meet USFS analysis needs. Joel reported that they are aiming to have these revisions complete and tested by early March. They hope to also by that time to make sure it easily links with the model that R-2 is putting together. Gary reported that R-2 has not yet completed its high flow data collection (completing only 8 out over 20 transects during recent high flows) and that they are working to calibrate their model.  REPORT ON OLD ACTION ITEMS <b7> ALL: Give Jerry feedback on Study Request R01: Additional Flow Releases for mitigation of water releases by January 17th so he can incorporate them and send out a new version of the request prior to our Feb. meeting. Only Joel and Lloyd gave comments. Additional comments on the request and related PME can be given to Jerry prior to March meeting. <b7> ALL: Give Dave feedback on Study Request R02: Evaluation of Optimal Flood Control Storage in Upper Baker Reservoir (Baker Lake) by January 17th so he can incorporate them and send out a new version of the request prior to our Feb. meeting.  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 2150 2/12/2003 MEETING NOTES L Wiltse for Economics/Operations Working Group.  Page 5   <b7> ALL: Gave Stan feedback on Study Request R03: An examination of spawning and incubation flows in the Skagit River below the Baker confluence during brood year 2000 by January 17th so he could incorporate them and send out a new version of the request prior to our Feb. meeting. <b7> Mark: By February 6, sent out draft outline of economic guidelines that Working Groups could use to do economic analysis of working group recommendations. No comments were received due to time constraints. HYDROPS OUTPUT Joel distributed a sample scenario for a HYDROP's run to demonstrate our process of fleshing out viable alternatives. Scenario was defined using the HYDROPS MODEL Study Request form. Attached was the output from the run. This output format does yet not include model modifications made at the request of the Forest Service. PRESENTATION OF SKAGIT COUNTY AVON BYPASS Dave showed us a video explaining the background of the Skagit River feasibility study and the recommendations of the Skagit Flood Risk Working Group. They are proposing a 5-mile (Westerly) diversion channel "the Swinomish Floodway" that could contain 80,000 cfs. The benefit/cost ratio of 4 to 1 is very favorable. They are also looking at providing adequate channel capacity to pass the 100-year flood flow through the 3-bridge corridor. Dave distributed a letter from the Skagit County Board of Commissioners to Corps Colonel Graves expressing their concern re: current levels of flood control. This letter points out the benefits of Baker Project for flood control. He also distributed a list of flood issues and costs associated with various phases of this project. FERC DEVELOPMENTAL ANALYSIS EXAMPLE Mark distributed a chapter from the Draft EIS for the Cowlitz River Project as an example of what we might include in our Developmental Analysis, noting that this was taken from a municipal utility as opposed to investor owned utility NEPA document. He encouraged us to look at this along with the 14 points of economic consideration that he distributed at an earlier meeting. He and Joel are working on putting together a template for Working Group members to use for economic analysis.
