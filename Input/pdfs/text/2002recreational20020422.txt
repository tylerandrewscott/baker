Sedro-Woolley  was not available. Will check Mt. Vernon (PSE) location is available for our May 20 meeting, with a  Skagit County facility as a backup  <b7> Chris: Talked to John re: re-installation of electronic traffic counters. Will try to do installation  this week.  <b7> Ann:  Not sure which version of ATM plan to provide. Will find out Forest Service direction,  and send Chris a copy of the forest-wide ATM plan.  <b7> Tony: Received boat ramp photos from Andy, had Kristen burn them on CDs and handed them  out to team members. Chris has two extra copies for people who did not attend today.  <b7> Chris  Invited Nancy to our April meeting  Baker River Project Relicense April 22, 2002 RECREATION Resources Working Group File: 4-22-02 rec mtg notes; Kristen Schuldt  2 of 7   <b7> Tony: Provided dispersed recreation site map with site location/codes and hung it up on wall. <b7> Chris: Checked with Ann to see if she needs help with the aesthetics study. Received email back that starting a draft study plan would be helpful. Ann indicated that the Forest Service has decided they did not need to do a full-blown SMS analysis for aesthetics. Rather, they would propose to use existing FS information (such as maps and computer-generated views) and identify appropriate viewpoints on which to base the analysis. Ann feels we are already doing a lot of the social part of the SMS analysis, and that we would want to concentrate on foreground and middleground views; it would not be necessary to include background viewpoints such as the top of Mt. Baker. <b7> Andy: Reviewed resort comment card information re: reservoir levels. He handed out information concerning comments from 1999 (there were none in 2000 or 2001), resort visitor numbers and 1999 reservoir levels. <b7> Andy: Added data field to comment cards  NEW MEMBERS Skagit County Parks and Recreation Department, represented (at least for today) by Earl Dierking.  R16: VISIONING EXERCISE Chris distributed copies of Section 2.9, Task 7: Visioning Exercise, from the R16 Needs Analysis study plan, to guide discussion of participants, format, timing and location for this task.  Participants The group agreed that participants to be invited to the visioning exercise should include those listed on page 13 of the January 30 study plan, which are: <b7> Existing members of the Recreation Working Group (now including Skagit County Parks) <b7> Washington Department of Natural Resources <b7> Town of Concrete <b7> Glacier Northwest <b7> Crown Pacific <b7> USFS recreation management staff <b7> Recreation Resource Management (FS campground concessioner) <b7> Whatcom County Parks and Recreation Department <b7> Whatcom County Sheriff's Department  Various members of the group suggested the following additions to the invitation list: <b7> Backcountry Horsemen <b7> Mountain biking groups <b7> Off-road recreation interests <b7> The Nature Conservancy <b7> North Cascades Conservation Council (N3C) <b7> Audubon Society <b7> Sierra Club <b7> tribal representative(s)  Baker River Project Relicense April 22, 2002 RECREATION Resources Working Group File: 4-22-02 rec mtg notes; Kristen Schuldt  3 of 7   <b7> USFS resource and law enforcement staff <b7> Skagit County/Bald Eagle Festival representative With respect to N3C, Tony indicated that Patrick Goldsworthy had said he wanted to be added to the Recreation Working Group mailing list, and would possibly start attending group meetings. Format Earl Dierking provided background information on the design charette that Skagit County Parks recently conducted, with the assistance of the National Park Service, for the Northern State Recreation Area master plan. That process involved 5 or 6 breakout groups addressing different issue or interest areas, with 6 to 7 members in each group. Participants were assigned to groups prior to the event, rather than self-selecting their group. Ann mentioned that the Forest Service was working on a process called Recreation Focus, which she thought might be a suitable model for us to use for the visioning exercise. She will be attending a meeting on Recreation Focus tomorrow (April 23), and will report back on development of the process and whether it appears to be something we should consider. After a rather lengthy discussion, Lauri suggested and the group agreed to create a teamlet to pursue further planning for the visioning exercise. Ann, Earl, Tony and Chris volunteered for the teamlet, which needs to convene prior to the May 20 working group meeting. [Members can expect an attempt to arrange a meeting and/or conference call during the week of May 6 <ad> CL] The group did come to a consensus that a workshop format would be appropriate for the visioning exercise. There would be a general session to inform all participants of the results of the preceding tasks of the needs analysis and provide instructions for small-group working sessions; participants would divide into small groups defined by topic areas for working discussions; and results from each group would be presented at a final plenary session. Timing Tentative points of agreement on timing aspects of the visioning exercise were: <b7> We should probably target some time around second week of September for the visioning exercise <b7> If planning has progressed far enough by then, we should place an announcement addressing purpose, timing and format for the visioning exercise on the Kiosk at the upcoming public meeting May 21st <b7> A one-day session should be planned for the exercise itself, with the option for site tours in advance, possibly the day before the wrokshop Location The group indicated a strong preference for PSE's Baker Lake Lodge as the best facility for the visioning exercise. The Lodge has sufficient capacity for a function of this size, and break-out space to  Baker River Project Relicense April 22, 2002 RECREATION Resources Working Group File: 4-22-02 rec mtg notes; Kristen Schuldt  4 of 7   accommodate four or five small groups. DETAILED REVIEW OF 2001 DATA R12 Site Inventory Chris handed out a set of Dispersed Site Inventory Summary Results (an Excel summary product generated from the Access database of site inventory records) and a Baker Lake Site Inventory Map (a topo map of the project area with locations of dispersed sites labeled and coded), both prepared by Nancy. The group viewed a draft of a CD that includes scanned images of the 2-page inventory record for each of the 213 sites, sketch maps of the sites, and photos for most of the sites, also created by Nancy from the inventory conducted last year. The CD record will be complete as soon as Nancy can obtain replacement photos for some of the sites, which will occur by about May 10. Nancy and Chris fielded a number of questions about the data in the Excel summary, information on the CD, and how the field staff interpreted and recorded conditions observed in the field. The group agreed that the entries of resource interest (such as predominant cover type) in Section 3 Physical Setting, in particular, should be viewed as layperson identification of "flags" for potential follow-up by agencies, other work groups or consultants, and not as scientific inventories of natural environment conditions. As at the March 25 meeting, the group discussed whether the Section 4 inventory entries for evidence of animal/human waste and trash (which in most cases were recorded in May 2001) were sufficiently reflective of these human use conditions during the peak recreation season. Chris agreed that more evidence of waste and trash would likely be present in August, for example, but noted that the dispersed site occupancy observations for the 2001 season could be used in conjunction with the inventory data to get a more up-to-date picture of sites where more waste and trash could be expected. R13 Visitor Survey Study, Use Observations Chris handed out three Excel summaries of dispersed site occupancy results from 2001 field observations, all titled "Dispersed Site Inventory Data" and prepared by Nancy from the database of visitor use observations. The spreadsheets are all derived from entries recorded on observation form O-3, Dispersed Site Occupancy through the R13 study during 2001. They include: <b7> a date-ordered listing of the number of dispersed sites (out of 213 total in the study area) occupied on each sampling date, along with figures for vehicles, boats, RVs and tents observed (O-3 Summary by Date) <b7> a date-ordered listing of the number and percent of sites occupied in each stratum (BE, BN, BW, SB and SR) on each sampling day (O-3 Sites Summary Occupied Only) <b7> a date-ordered summary by stratum (5 worksheets total) of sites occupied, vehicles, boats, RVs and tents observed on each sampling day The remaining meeting time permitted little discussion of these handouts. Chris asked that everyone review the handouts outside the meeting and circulate observations or questions by e-mail in the near future. Work will continue on processing the observation data and refining the summaries.
