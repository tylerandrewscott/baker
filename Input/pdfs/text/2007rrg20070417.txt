Substantively, the application of the quorum rule in the Resource Group, was discussed. The issues pertaining to the quorum rule were revisited, and Cary reported that the BRICC teamlet to address this issue would proceed in the near future and this subject would likely be discussed at the next full BRICC meeting scheduled for April 25. Concern was expressed about being able to move RRG issues forward if a quorum was not present for RRG meetings in the future. Cary will keep RRG posted, and report any BRICC consensus for the quorum rule in the RRG. All members will check with their BRICC counterparts as needed for this discussion. FERC/BRICC STATUS/UPDATE The Town of Concrete recently issued the shoreline substantial development permit as a predicate to Ecology's issuance of its 401 certification and CZMA determination. With all local review now completed, Ecology's 401 and CZMA are ready to issue. Andrea reported that the Town of Concrete will be holding one more hearing for the limited purpose of confirming SMP adoption, on May 7. The USFWS and NMFS Biological Opinions are still pending, with anticipated release near the end of April for the USFWS opinion. PROJECT BOUNDARY UPDATE RRG members acknowledged work on project boundary issues is ongoing and many details will be completed when requirements are known after license is issued. ONGOING PROJECT ACTIVITIES / ACTIVITIES IN/NEAR PROJECT AREA Initial work related to the Baker Lake Resort redevelopment and decommissioning is proceeding, in the form of the identification of information needs through discussions between PSE and the USFS. PSE is in the process of preparing background information on values associated with the existing campground. Jamie has reviewed digital orthotic photos with 5' contour intervals at 100 scale for base mapping, and Cary will review proposed base mapping to move this item forward. Jamie has some ideas on an initial approach to planning for the work for this article and will discuss the ideas with FS and PSE preliminarily. The USFS indicated an interest in accelerating the schedule for the conversion work due to the December 2008 expiration of the special use authorization. Ann, Pam, Jamie and Cary agreed to review some of the related information needs together and will report back to the RRG at the next meeting. Ann reported that there is some cobbling and shoreline reshaping work taking place at Horseshoe Cove related to cultural site protection. Pam reported that road access to Lake Shannon is being impeded by a private property owner. This may affect viability of this site for Article 305.  Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 RRG Final Meeting Notes, April 17, 2007  Page 2 of 4   IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE Pam presented a timeline for the recreational license article requirements based upon required subtasks and assumptions on the timing of license issuance. The RRG reviewed the timeline and subtasks listed for each article and discussed some of the bigger picture planning requirements for the Article 301 report and the relationship of this report to the other plans. Cary proposed preparing a "model" plan for RRG discussion that would reflect a uniform approach to plan completion and submission consistent with the articles. Due to the initial work related to Article 303, this article will be used as an example for this model plan, which Cary will provide to the RRG for review and discussion at the next meeting. The following specific comments were made regarding scheduling associated with the following articles: Article 303 <ad> Ann indicated RRG may need to build in some environmental checkpoints related to this scheduled item. Some additional definition of timing for subtasks was also desired. Articles 306, 307, 308, 309, 310 <ad> Ann indicated FS was internally reviewing timing of some of the tasks as they relate to the license not having yet been issued and FS needs. All agreed that once the license is issued, the parties will review the implementation schedule for the various articles as a part of reviewing the license. If the license is issued prior to the next RRG meeting, a mini-workshop relating to any RRG implementation scheduling issues will be done at the next meeting. Article 312 <ad> Ann indicated that the FS was working on creating line items for specific license article work in the collection agreement that is being prepared for some aspects of future license implementation. Article 316 <ad> PSE reported that three portions of FS 1106 had recently been washed out at three culvert locations and work was being done to continue to provide access. For all license articles, discussion regarding the need for coordination among various parties for future RRG implementation work occurred, as well as coordination related to shared resources with other implementation resource groups. It was noted that certain RRG articles would be of primary interest to certain limited parties, and the level of coordination and collaboration would need to be addressed. All agreed to provide any input they have regarding how best to coordinate with interested/required parties on implementation activities for any specific RRG articles, with the expectation that monitoring coordination would need to be an ongoing activity during license implementation.
