Baker River Project Relicense 2 of 8 Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 7-11-02_Final_fishWG_notes; Lyn Wiltse FRAMING ISSUES FOR SETTLEMENT Dee Endelman, of Agreement Dynamics presented the Solution Team’s request that she start working with the Working Groups (approximately 90 minutes each meeting to begin coming up with a very sketchy draft of potential aquatics-related PMEs. She distributed a draft outline of the process along with an initial framing of the 52 Issues this group originally defined. Prior to this meeting, Arnie reviewed the issues and came up with 8 Issues (framed as problems to be solved). All were asked to review this list of eight to see that the interests of their organizations are represented. We did a consensus check about going forward with this process, in hopes of having a preliminary list of PMEs - or areas flagged where we need study data before considering PME for the Solution Team by October, 2002. All were at least grudgingly agreeable to move forward, with the greatest concern being limited time to come up with anything of real value for the developing and time it might detract from discussing/developing Studies. Dee will meet with a teamlet between now and our next meeting to create a matrix to help us through the complexity of this process. A list of issues regarding this process was discussed: • Cross pollination of Working Group ideas • Definition of PMEs • Identify as soon as possible, the NEPA alternatives • Submit comments on Scoping Document #1, in particular, make sure it is consistent with Process Document re: alternatives • Flag technical issues as we get to “solutions” – so we don’t create problems for other groups • Two-day discussion of technical representatives of Working Groups to see how it all fits together (this Winter.) INSTREAM FLOWS TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP (A9) Phil walked us through the notes from the July 8 Technical Working Group meeting. He also reviewed the Draft Outline of the Middle Skagit River Instream Flow Study. REPORT FROM FISH PASSAGE TECHNICAL WORKING GROUPS From end of April to 3rd week in June conducted near field studies in forebay. We tracked individual fish, 24 hr/day, under different operating conditions. We also conducted radio tagging far field testing on individual fish throughout the reservoir (also under different operating conditions).. The 3rd Study involved radio tagging of 10 kelts throughout the reservoir. There were 2 casualties out of the 10 steelhead kelts tagged, one believed to be due to fisherman catch and the other positively attributed to an eagle. Some kelts moved right to the gulper and others hung out above. The 4th Study was pit tagging. We will be using data from these studies to determine studies for next year. Early results will be in August. Final results will be in September. Baker River Project Relicense 3 of 8 Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 7-11-02_Final_fishWG_notes; Lyn Wiltse The next meeting will be August 6th. They will be discussing the footprint for upstream passage alternatives they have advanced (trap-and-haul for Lower Baker) STUDY REQUEST SUBMITTALS/STUDY PLAN DEVELOPMENT Study # Title Notes/Next Steps A01.A Reservoir Tributary Habitat Surveys Emily will be combining the results of this survey with the results of A26b into a single report (stream catalog) Folks were comfortable with the survey methodology that called for investigating all streams designed as priority level 1 or 2. We upgraded the mainstream Baker River above tributary 13 to a priority level 2 with the condition that the National Park Service will assist. A01.B Reservoir Tributary Biological Surveys Not discussed at this meeting. We will have a draft report this spring. A01.C Reservoir Tributary Delta Surveys Emily noted that, for the most part, the reservoirs refilled before the tribs warmed up enough for trout to commence spawning. The results of the spring 2002 field efforts will be incorporated with A-01a, A-01b and A-26b into a single report. A02 LB River Habitat Mapping No changes since last meeting. A03 Reservoir Fish Population No changes since last meeting. Characteristics A04 LB/Skagit River Flow, Gaging No changes since last meeting. A05 Water Quality Sampling No changes since last meeting. A06 UB Passage Design Baffle Complete. Modification A07 Lower Baker Forebay Bathymetric Complete. Survey A08 UB Passage System Evaluation The study report from R-2 is complete. A09A Skagit River Flow and Habitat Phil reviewed the approach that the Technical Assessment (HIGH PRIORITY) Working Group members have agreed to. The aim is to collect data to understand flow effects under different operating regimes (Baker alone, Baker and Skagit, and Baker, Skagit and Sauk). We will be looking at compensatory and additive effects in the varial zone (size, elevation, frequency of inundation, etc.) The formalization of this Study Plan will follow the initial work of transect selection (to take advantage of summer low flows, etc.) A09B Salmonid Redd Selection and There has been no movement on this since Baker River Project Relicense 4 of 8 Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 7-11-02_Final_fishWG_notes; Lyn Wiltse Maintenance in the Middle Skagit in Stan submitted it. Stan and Gary will follow Response to River Fluctuation from up with Phil re: suggested methodology. Hydropower Peaking A09C Distribution, Timing and Depth of Adam Weybright (R2) had prepared a Salmonid Redds PowerPoint slide show that summarized the results of the 2002 steelhead surveys. Phil walked us through the results of that survey. Visibility was a challenge during the spring. We will look at integrating tributary spawning data (WDFW) on timing and distribution into the final report. For the fall 2002, Phil suggests 3 levels of survey effort: aerial, jet boat, and a combination platter (“full meal deal” which includes all of the above plus a cat-a-raft). He distributed a proposal that included the timing and estimated costs associated with each level. If differences in spawning from Hamilton to Concrete and Hamilton to Sedro Woolley are noted, we would expand the survey effort accordingly. Phil agreed to add a “full meal deal” in December. If a lot of redds are observed (defined as 20-30), the survey effort will be expanded to measure characteristics of those redds. Question for fall survey: Do we measure redds between Baker and the Sauk? A09D Distribution, Timing of Salmonid Fry Still waiting for NMFS collection permit. We have lost our window for studying juvenile chinook – but we could set up study sites for next year – maybe do some brief electro- fishing and confirm presence/absence of juvenile chinook in the meantime.
