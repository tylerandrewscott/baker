Be clear about what form of output (e.g., copy, etc.) you desire. Be specific about constraints. <b7> Bob & Lloyd: Summarize some of the scenarios they (PSE) are having the modelers model. <b7> Stan: Discuss constraints for model with resource agencies. <b7> Chris: Reduce Emergency Action Plan map and give a copy to Lyn. <b7> Lloyd: Check FERC regulations of Emergency Action Plan as they pertain to this group Agenda for April 11, 2001 at PSE Office in Mt.

They will work to meet these interests when they get to the point of suggesting options for solution. CHARLES HOWARD'S HYDRO OPTIMIZATION MODEL <ad> Presented by Bob Barnes and Lloyd Pernela This is a real-time watershed operational model used to determine the best operation of each of the turbines while satisfying operational constraints and resource availability. This model can be set up to produce power output (with assigned differential values) on an hourly basis. It also allows for seasonal adjustments, e.g. snow melt. PSE is fine tuning this model and will begin using it for operations and forecasting. If team members become confident in the capability of this model, Charles Howard & Associates (as an independent third party) would analyze various scenarios using this model and databases to assist this team. NOTE: All models have different constructs. Consistent use of a model affords us a standardized methodology to compare relative impacts of various scenarios, e.g. one rule curve against another, or a dry year versus normal versus wet. The key in comparing different models is standardization of constraints and assumptions. The approval of this model Economics Working Group participants for the Baker Relicensing Process will require their confidence in Hydrops ability to simulate sixty years of weather and operations and determine optimal operations scenarios for given changes in operations and facilities. This review maybe beyond the experience of some team members. We probably don't want to dig into the "nuts and bolts" of the model. One approach maybe to hire consulting/peer review to help validate the model as a meaningful tool for this process. After establishing base case for comparisons the major challenge for this team is to define/ structure the scenarios that will be run through this model. We need to get meaningful results from realistic scenarios. Using a simple simulation for a small Pacific coast basin rainfall and snow pack and dam constraints, Bob walked the group through process of making monthly reservoir operations decisions for a year assuming normal precipitation, snow pack, temperature. The primary objective in this demonstration was to avoid spill.
