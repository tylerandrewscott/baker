Kelly: Send Elizabeth some scenarios to use as examples in portraying decision and quorum rules for CRAG over the life of the license. Elizabeth: Get update on Mitigation Plan (or MOA?). Jan: Send comments on Treatment Plan to Chris, Jan: Figure out arrangement for FS gate key for the rest of the year – ASAP. Elizabeth: Check with other CRAG members re: comments on Treatment Plan.

Report on Outstanding Action Items: Elizabeth wrote a letter to notify FERC of the measures taken, through consultation with the CRAG, to address direct effects to the Upper Baker Barge. This letter also proposed that any cumulative effects of this action on the Historic District be addressed through ongoing consultation with the SHPO and the CRAG through the process outlined in the HPMP. Elizabeth is keeping track of drawdown levels. If the reservoir elevation drops below 680’ she will contact Chris to do more inventory. Chris prepared a preliminary budge to support the Treatment Plan Jan complete the ARPA permit. (There was great rejoicing!) She also reported there will be a NEPA meeting on April 1 to discuss the Treatment Plan. Site stabilization during drawdown. This will be accomplished in 3 phases: 1. Surface collection 2. Bank facing and stabilization Baker River Project - FERC Project No. 2150 Interim Cultural Resources Advisory Group Meeting March 19, 2008 Page 2 of 6   3. Testing and data recovery Longer Term Action Items: Elizabeth will draft a description of documentation for CRAG to review, for insertion into the Baker Master Plan, so that it is part of PSE’s process to consider with every project. Elizabeth will collect data for a new table for those buildings that have not been evaluated, and include a DOE schedule. (She handed this over to HRA). Elizabeth will see if the Museum newspaper project can be added to the Master Plan. 1.  Review Notes/Agenda/Action Items: Agenda The agenda reviewed and the idea of technical working groups was added to the BRICC portion of the agenda. We also added the topic of Decision Making Protocols for discussion after the BRICC update.  2.  Review Recent BRICC Activities / License Update BRICC Elizabeth reported that the BRICC din not meet in February. Their next meeting will be at the WDFW Office in Mill Creek on March 26. They will be discussing the status of the license and will also be reviewing the status of the various working groups with an emphasis on early implementation activities in the Aquatics arena and also PMF (Probable Maximum Flood). License Update Elizabeth reported that the most recent information she has shows that the Bi-Op is still under NMFS review and has not yet been issued to FERC. Decision Making Process Outstanding Issues re: Decision Making Process: What exactly constitutes a “decision”? Decision Protocol (Article 601 in Settlement Agreement) o Section 106 /HPMP o PA (Doesn’t address conflict resolution) CRAG rep on BRCC? Inside or outside Section 106 – what process do we use? Consider enlisting Frank (from FERC) to help sort out this process? Intra-resource team communication (Terrestrial, Recreation, Aquatics) Communication of notification of concerns – Is this handled through PSE? Elizabeth shared copies of the March 17 email from Cary Feldmann stating that PSE is placing the hatchery construction on hold pending license issuance. This is due to pending NEPA and permitting issues. The delay in license issuance has caused PSE to miss the window that would have allowed them to build the trap without disturbing upstream migration. They will continue design work in the meantime.  3.  Status of Settlement Agreement Projects Floating Surface Collector  Baker River Project - FERC Project No. 2150 Interim Cultural Resources Advisory Group Meeting March 19, 2008 Page 3 of 6   The FSC has been ballasted and leveled and they are working out the electrical kinks. Anyone interested in getting a tour was invited to let Elizabeth know. Adult Trap Frank Postlewaite, from R2 Resource Consultants, gave a slide show and virtual overview at our February meeting of the proposed plan for the Lower Baker Adult Trap, outlining changes to the existing trap. The same presentation was given to the Recreation Resources Group. Elizabeth reported that they will be coming back and giving us an update after incorporating the input received from these presentations. Discussion: Would we reach a finding of effect once the plans have been finalized? The Section 106 process is clear: Are we trying to implement the HPMP in the spirit of what it is? PSE is reviewing a draft of the mitigation plan that Elizabeth prepared. (We need to mitigate any adverse effect to a historic property.) Elizabeth reported that we are ready to convert this to an MOA if so ordered by FERC. Either way there will be a plan to deal with the adverse effects of the FSC, spawning beaches, FSC at upper and ultimately for the FSC that is constructed at Lower Baker as well. After the internal review, Elizabeth will run the draft by CRAG members for comments. She is also looking at interpretation and educational opportunities within the cultural and recreational arenas. LB Powerhouse There was nothing new to report. This project is out in the future a bit. Elizabeth will be working with Chris on this to come up with a work plan. There is a plan to recover soils that need to be remediated there. It is not clear what, if any, value might come from monitoring or limited salvage. There will be a lot of safety issues. They are currently doing feasibility studies on the best placement for the new powerhouse. Channel Creek Spawning Beaches Elizabeth reported that HABS HAER has been done and we are waiting for field verification. 4.  We had our usual Working Lunch  5.  2008 CRAG Work Plan We clarified that by 2008 we are referring to the 2008 calendar year. We brainstormed some of the elements that should be included in the plan: Training of PSE staff and contractors Training of PSE executives Stabilization plan Collection Sites (list sites – 4 of which require drawdown) Monitoring (at least annually) Historic Structures Report Adult Trap Review Other upcoming Projects  Baker River Project - FERC Project No. 2150 Interim Cultural Resources Advisory Group Meeting March 19, 2008 Page 4 of 6   Sept. Field Trip to Shannon Site (we will need a boat for this) Discussion: Elizabeth will put together a table outlining the work the CRAG will be engaged in for the remaining of 2008. We will review this at our April meeting. We discussed the importance of training (as outlined in the HPMP) to raise awareness of HPMP of PSE staff and contractors – contact list and protocol – Perhaps Larry could provide cultural context re: What is sacred? Right now the 2008 plan would likely include only the initial part of the stabilization effort. It would also include potential collection (assuming we get comments back) when there is still a drawdown) – list which locations require collection this year. Monitoring is set to occur this fall. Elizabeth has the historic structures report happening at the Washington Portland Cement Company Historic District in draft. This should be back to Elizabeth shortly for review and dissemination to the team. The adult trap review will be ongoing as will the Determination of Eligibility for historic structures. Elizabeth assured team members that she wants to make sure we are addressing everything that needs to be done from an archaeological standpoint. CRAG Meeting Dates We are currently meeting the 3rd Wed of every month. We agreed to go ahead and hold the 3rd Wednesday of each month and then cancel on a month-by-month basis. We may want to skip some months during heavy field season. The default meeting location will be the PSE Burlington Office. 6.  Treatment Plan Jan announced that she got the ARPA permit out and it will be good for 5 years! Elizabeth mailed out the draft plan to CRAG members for review shortly after the last CRAG meeting (February 20). Since then she got feedback from Ron Kent who felt that everything discussed had been included and said he felt comfortable with the plan and had no further comments. Larry also commented on it and said it looked pretty good. He will run it by other tribal members for their feedback. Elizabeth will check with others also for their comments. We will see if we are ready to finalize the draft at our April meeting. Confidential Information Redacted  Update on Who Does What FERC – Frank Ecton is Compliance. Heather Campbell – Federal Preservation Officer. Frank Winchell is still available to help us on process matters. PSE – Paul Wetherbee is in charge of baker License implementation.
