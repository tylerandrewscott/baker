BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT106/25/02 MEETING Cultural and Historic Resources Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 1   NEW ACTION ITEMS: • ALL: Review UDP; Get final comments to Jessie by August 19 meeting. • ALL: Review drawdown survey, strategy language in final Research Design and come to the August meeting with suggestions for wording to capture our discussion of 100% coverage. • ALL: Get Jessie feedback on RFP/Contractor list by Monday, July 1. • Jessie: Send out sample HYDROPS scenarios that would be appropriate for this Working Group. Also how will it work? Can we run scenarios instantaneously? What is cost? • Jessie:: Check possibility of HYDROPS demonstration at our September 10 meeting. • Jessie: Ask Joetta (R2) to update our APE maps, including dispersed recreation sites within a ¼ mile buffer from the shoreline of both reservoirs. Send to participants as soon as it is available. • Jessie: Send out Aquatics Study Plan when it becomes available. • Jessie: Set up Interim Plan Teamlet conference call. • Ardis: Call Frank re: sample interim plan. • Jessie: Find original Forest Service’s special use permit. • ALL: Review APE related guidelines for examples that will help us further define our APE (audio/visual/atmospheric effects of Project). • Jessie: Send Rob & Ardis copies of handouts from today’s meeting.

Evaluate Meeting REPORT ON OLD ACTION ITEMS • Jessie distributed handouts re the Baker River HYDROPS model. These included an overview of the capabilities of the model and a draft of a scenario request form. • Jessie: Looked at the Baker License and any ongoing protocol to handle cultural resource issues during project operations/development. How does it support the National Forest Plan? The license BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT206/25/02 MEETING Cultural and Historic Resources Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 2   •  article is vague here. It just says to comply with forest plans. There have been discussions on timber sales, etc. on the Special Use Permit. Janis has not seen a copy of that permit. She reported that from that time period (around 1956), it would contain language that was very vague. There was no program-specific language. We will form a technical teamlet to come up with a plan to address cultural/historical issues that can arise from plant operations in the interim. We will review the plan at this group. Members: Rob, Jan Hollenbeck, Ardis, Jessie, Scott. Janis: Sent Jessie copy of FS manual dealing with NAGPRA procedures.  PROCESS DOCUMENT & COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL Jessie reminded the group that when discussing culturally sensitive information, only members listed on the Baker River Cultural & Historical Resources Working Group distribution list can attend. Janis Bouma’s name will be removed as she is leaving MBSNF. We may choose to open up these meetings on occasion to deal with issues such as historical buildings. We could also handle these discussions with technical Working Groups. Connie reported that PSE has received six letters of support for the ALP, with promises of at least four others. Janis reminded us that we need to be consistent with NAGPRA in the Communications Protocol (relates to footnote in confidentiality section). ARCHAEOLOGY CONTRACTOR Jessie reported that due to a conflict of interest, HRA has been removed from doing additional archaeological work for the relicense. She distributed copies of the Request for Proposal for a new contractor to finish up the archaeology work that we previously defined. PSE wants to send the RFP out by July 12, so members are encouraged to give her any feedback on the RFP itself and/or the list of contractors on the recipient list. Time is critical as it may take a couple of months for them to get an ARPA permit and we want them to be able to do work in the drawdown zone this fall. Bob suggested that we state in the RFP that 100% (minus safety and other considerations) of the drawdown zone would be surveyed. We might also call that out as a clarification of the original Research Design put together by HRA. This was also a tribal concern and is what HRA was doing in their surveys of the drawdown zone. Archaeological Reports: HRA is in the process of finishing up the ARPA report for the Forest Service. This includes their findings on Forest Service land. Other results of their surveys (e.g., Lake Shannon) will be turned over to the new archaeology contractors. The new contractor will complete their own ARPA report. They will also write the draft and final FERC archaeological report (incorporating HRA’s findings as background information). They will also probably author the CRMP.

The tribes will be coming up with their APE for TCPs that would extend beyond the FERC boundary. The tribes are concerned that cultural issues /sensitivities beyond archaeology are addressed. PSE is in the midst of working out how they interface with the tribes on TCPs. Rob suggested that we expand our working definition to include land acquired for terrestrial/recreational P/M/Es. We agreed to do this. Additionally, we clarified that in point number #2 under section "APE includes:" on our APE Working Definition paper, we are talking about 40 horizontal meters above the fluctuation zone. The effects of changes to the Project will need to be addressed by the CRMP, as will changes in regulations. DISCUSSION OF UNANTICIPATED DISCOVERY PLAN (UDP) PSE distributed a memo addressing unanticipated discoveries to all contractors working in the field (at Baker River Project) from other resource area Working Groups. The memo called for anyone to notify Charles Morton, Plant Manager, in the event of any unanticipated discoveries. Jessie distributed the current version of the UDP for our review.
