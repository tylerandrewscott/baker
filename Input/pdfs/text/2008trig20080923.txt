Ira also gave us an update on current land acquisition activity, specifically the offer to purchase the X property. REVIEW OF DRAFT PROCESS DOCUMENTS Haley walked us through the updated Land Acquisition Process Flow Chart and Action List. Teamlet members discussed many of the aspects and details of the process, and with a couple of small edits, agreed that the current drafts were ready for a wider review. We will be providing the process documents to the TRIG group at the October 2nd, 2008 meeting for their review and comments. Next steps will be to start development of several of the items listed in sections 1, 2 and 3 (habitat criteria development is already underway). REVIEW TABLE OF FUNDING AVAILABILITY A table showing the funding available for acquisition and management for the four acquisition articles, listed by license year, was provided to the group. There was discussion for a need to have an accounting process for dollars spent and habitats acquired, and a process for determining allocations based on habitat types. Both of those processes are identified in the process Action List and are important next steps for the teamlet to work on. DRAFT CRITERIA FORMAT Haley shared with the group a preliminary draft of a habitat criteria table. The group did not spend much time on review, but agreed that it was a good start and that we will continue to work on developing the criteria. Anna will be working on refining the criteria format for next meeting. NEXT STEPS PSE will bring the updated process documents for review at the next TRIG meeting to get TRIG member input on the process, then update for the next LAP Teamlet meeting. The teamlet will also be working on habitat criteria and other processes to be developed in steps 1, 2 and 3 in the process Action List. No date was determined for the next LAP teamlet meeting, but will discuss the timing for it at the upcoming TRIG meeting.
