Evaluate meeting  INTRODUCTIONS The team welcomed first-time members Jim Eychaner, Fred Seavey, Bob Nelson, Arn Thoreen, and Derek Koellmann. PARTICIPATION AND PROCESS The group spent an hour discussing process, participation, and authorities. They also began discussion about how the Solution Team works. It is PSE's intent to file the Notice of Intent and request for ALP by April 30, 2001.  There was discussion around the advantages of going ALP vs. Traditional. It was agreed that ALP usually results in less FERC arbitration and allows resource needs to be addressed in a more timely manner than the traditional process. FERC's decision will be binding on PSE.  COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOL Copies of the Communications Protocol were distributed to each member. Connie walked the group through the document. It was suggested that we use a table to track initial comments/suggestions for revision. As we move closer to a final version, we will use a "red-line" strike-out version. Final documents will be available to all in hard copy. When Connie receives comments from Solution Team members (by February 9th), she will run substantive changes by members of the Process Team. The Process Team will draft a recommended version and send it out along with the non-substantive changes to members by February 21st for their review. At our February 28th meeting, we hope to finalize the draft of the Communication Protocol.  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 1/24/2001 MEETING NOTES Baker Solution Team FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 2   PROCESS DOCUMENT Lloyd Pernela briefly ran through the format and content of the Process Document, which will be appended to the Communications Protocol. PSE will add an appendix to the Process Document listing all relevant authorities along with a brief summary of the substance of each statute as it relates to the relicensing of the Baker River Project. They will also include a contact list of participants in the process. Agencies with mandatory authority are in the process of putting together a Memorandum of Understanding/Agreement with PSE to hammer out differences among themselves in the hopes that it will facilitate the process. The Memorandum of Understanding will include issues/operating procedures related to the Communications Protocol and Process Document. PSE will do one more revision of the Process Document and send out an electronic copy to members by January 31st. Members will review the document and send comments to Connie by March 9th. She will collate changes and send out a red-line revision by March 21st for discussion at the March 28th meeting.

This form was created by a collaborative effort including PSE and the agencies. It has been introduced to all working groups and they have already begun using it. The Solution Team will begin reviewing studies at the next meeting.
