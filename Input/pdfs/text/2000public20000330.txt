The purpose of these meetings was to present information on the hydroelectric project, explain the relicensing process, and discuss how the public can participate in relicensing. The meetings were attended by 74 people representing the public, local jurisdictions, and resource agencies. After the presentation portion of the meetings, Puget Sound Energy representatives were available to discuss topics and answer questions regarding the different resource areas (e.g. fish & aquatic resources) or the relicensing process. A package of information was distributed to each attendee which included an agenda and copies of the presentation slides. Also included in the package was a card requesting general contact information. This card also requested that the meeting participants select their area(s) of interest and possible degree of involvement in the relicensing process. The date of April 26, 2000, at the same times and locations, was announced for the next set of public meetings.  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT FERC PROJECT NO. 2150    2000public20000330.pdf en
