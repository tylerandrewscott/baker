Sent list to Lia at liakruger@hotmail.com, 19997 Hwy 9, Mt.

Drafted list of questions for FERC rep to address on November 28th at Skagit Co. Admin. Building in Mount Vernon 9am-3pm. TERRESTRIAL REFERENCE CONDITIONS We agreed that we are not going after mitigation for original impacts. We will use a forward-looking process. We will gather some historical data to assist us in predicting what may be possible in the future without the project over the license period. This is based on the continuing impacts approach advocated by the Forest Service. Issues that may not fully be addressed by this (e.g. ESA) may need to be handled separately. REVIEW OF NEW STUDY REQUESTS RT-19: Habitat Evaluation Studies Lauri walked us through the revised study request, having incorporated the input she received from Stan. Aim: Measure habitat value over time <ad> Quantifies baseline for PM&E measures. We will create a teamlet to hammer out the detail of this study, incorporating the analysis species assessment data and cover type data. Lauri recommends waiting until Spring to flush this out into a study plan. We agreed to move this to the next stage.  RT-20: Wildlife Use in the reservoir Drawdown Zone BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 11/15/2001 MEETING NOTES L Wiltse for Terrestrial Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 3 of 5   Aim: To identify existing wildlife uses within the drawdown zone to assist us in determining PM&E measures. We discussed the various protocols that may need to be called out depending on the species we determine we need to study. We will tie this request to the Analysis Species Assessment. We will defer discussion of this request until then. As a next step we might survey elk in Spring while conducting general recognition of other species while out there.  UPDATE ON ONGOING STUDIES STATUS OF: T-2: Vegetation Mapping in Project Area Tom distributed an update of work done on this study. Just completed the field work. Working on database entry forms (for Access database). Finished all of fieldwork at Baker Lake and Lake Shannon. They will do drawdown work in the Spring. Asked for feedback on definitions he provided for the various vegetation cover type classifications that had been referenced, but not defined in the study plan.  T-4: Analysis Species Assessment Lia distributed a list of habitats found in the Baker River Watershed with the definitions of the habitat associations she used. She also passed out the Johnson & O'Neal definitions of the vegetation mapping cover types. The next step will be to make a list of potential future habitats & species that may come to exist over the next 50 years.  T-5: Wetland Inventory Study They went back and did new plots according to modifications we discussed making to forested wetland types (i.e. deciduous and coniferous). Six wetland polygons at Shannon still need to be complete by yearend. (Team leader note: I checked on this after the meeting, and there are about 10 left to do at Lake Shannon and the mouth of the Baker River at Concrete).  T-11: Oregon Spotted Frog Inventory Completed. Still awaiting data from amphibian studies.  T-13: Survey and Manage Terrestrial Mollusk Survey Got maps from Joetta. Surveyed all of Baker (2 plots per 10 acre usage). Found 2 Survey & Manage species. Will be doing second visit in Spring (same units different plots).  T-15: Basin Vegetation Mapping Joetta at R2 has lots of GIS datasets on Basin Vegetation Mapping. We are still awaiting information from Crown Pacific (cover type), & DNR (WNHP). We are also awaiting updated information from WDFW (old growth maps, streamnet information, PHS polygons, wildlife heritage points, etc.). Tony posted GIS maps he'd received from the FS & Park Service. He distributed cover type maps he received from other sources (DNR & FS). We have 3 basic needs: <b7> Site Potential <b7> Non-Forest values (FS grizzly habitat/Pacific Meridian data, wetlands, etc.) <b7> Seral Stage  T-17: Amphibian Studies in Reservoir Fluctuation Zone  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 11/15/2001 MEETING NOTES L Wiltse for Terrestrial Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 4 of 5   Summer and Fall work completed - finished early November. In Spring will do 3rd visit (drawdown zone mostly).  REVIEW UPDATED STUDY REQUESTS R-T16 Rare Plants Ann R checked with the Recreational Working Group members and found that they have not clearly defined "dispersed sites." They do, however, have a nearly complete list/map of them that we can use to help define our survey area. Hamer Environmental will work with Ann to begin drafting this study design. This study will be ongoing, as we are able to integrate other survey areas. There is an advantage to waiting as long as possible on this as the Survey and Manage list changes. We expect the new list sometime in the first quarter 2002.  R-T18 Breeding Birds We will use the habitats defined by Don's teamlet (Analysis Species) to define the survey area. We could also use control vs. impacted sites to look at effects of recreation. We need to figure out how data from this survey could help us determine PM&E. This study could be a PM&E. We will revisit this after we complete the analysis species work.  REVIEW PREVIOUSLY PROPOSED STUDY REQUESTS AS TO STATUS R-T6: Noxious Weed Assessment and Control Plan Aim: Find, control & plan for future prevention of noxious weeds in the Project Area. The actual assessment work will likely begin in mid summer. We still need to define area & protocol. Teamlet members are: Ann, Laurel, Tony, & Bill with Skagit County Noxious Weed Control.  R-T7: Future Reference Condition Vegetation of the UB and LB Projects (new name) Need to button up with Continuing Impacts teamlet. Review 1/26 Study Request & identify the deficiencies/additional considerations that need to be included to make this the "future reference conditions" study.  RT-12: Grizzly Bear Spring Foraging Habitat Value Need to review Study Request & identify the deficiencies/additional considerations that need to be included to finalize this study request.
