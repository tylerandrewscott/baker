BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 10/16/2001 MEETING NOTES L Wiltse for Terrestrial Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 2 of 6   <b7> Tony, Tom, Marty: Prepare proposal for data management REPORT ON PAST ACTION ITEMS. <b7> Patrick distributed climate change information related to the 30-50 year license period prepared by Conway Leovy, Professor Emeritus, Atmospheric Sciences and Geophysics. Tony will share this information with the other Working Group Team Leaders, as it relates to several resource areas. We appreciate Patrick's efforts in calling this important topic to our attention. SOLUTION TEAM UPDATE The Technical Working Group has finished making edits to the Communication Protocol and Process Documents. Both documents have been distributed to Solution Team members for review prior to the next meeting which will be October 24, at the Forest Office Mountlake Terrace. In the meantime, PSE's attorney is getting the attorneys of the major agencies together to hammer out the legal lingo re: confidentiality, definition of consensus, and evidence. NORTHWEST FOREST PLAN AND WATERSHED ANALYSIS PRESENTATION Carl Corey gave a very informative presentation on the NW Forest Plan as it relates to relicensing the Baker River Project Relicensing Process. His presentation (Power Point) will be available on the Website. The Forest Plan is primarily concerned with old growth ecosystems. It focuses on species viability. The first question is whether it is possible to maintain species viability with existing structures/processes in place. If that is not possible, then efforts would be made to restore function and processes needed to ensure species viability. The Watershed Analysis focuses on understanding the ecological structure, functions, processes and interactions occurring within a watershed. It is concerned with understanding reference conditions. Terrestrial findings (as paraphrased by Carl) include: <b7> LSR's (Late-Successional Reserves) Habitat connectivity disrupted by the project <b7> Habitat diversity reduced due to inundation of productive riparian and upland vegetation types <b7> Riparian structure and function also impaired by inundation, disruption in connectivity <b7> Grizzly bear <ad> points to limiting recreational use within BMU <ad> middle Swift Creek core area. Spring foraging habitat limiting <b7> Noxious weeds <ad> occurrence enhanced due to inundation zone and relationship to project-related recreation use <b7> Sensitive Survey & Manage plant species <ad> lack if information re: high potential for occurrence due to high diversity of productivity of areas adjacent to reservoirs <b7> Big Game <ad> low elevation, productive and riparian sites inundated. Best habitat lower in watershed, but private/agricultural concerns. Opportunity to manage inundation zone for enhanced forage. <b7> Project-related recreation <ad> potential botanical species impacts, possibly mountain goats (?) UPDATE ON ONGOING STUDIES STATUS OF: T-4: Analysis Species Assessment Tom distributed an update on this assessment. We reviewed the Analysis Species Matrix. Species that made the list were either listed or that met two or more of the criteria we identified. Lia: Make a list of  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 10/16/2001 MEETING NOTES L Wiltse for Terrestrial Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 3 of 6   habitat types that exist in the Basin or have the potential to exist over the license period , based on Johnson and O'Neill Marty: Put together a technical work group to review and approve/approve of the guilding process used by Lia (Lia, Lauri, Fred, Bob Don, Stan). All members were asked to send list of habitat/species that we feel we need to be assessed. Send list to Lia at liakruger@hotmail.com, 19997 Hwy 9, Mt. Vernon, WA, 98274.  T2: Vegetation Mapping in Project Area The vegetation above the drawdown zone for Baker Lake was mapped by October 2, for Shannon Lake by November 2. We are starting to put these data into GIS format. We hope to have this complete by yearend.  T5: Wetland Inventory Study Forest Wetlands will be split into deciduous and conifers for the sake of consistency. When the lake is drawn all the way down, we will identify three zones (upper perennial, intermittent, and lower perennial). These modifiers are listed in the study plan. The zones will help identify wet areas in the drawdown zone that we may want to conduct studies in, and will aid in continuing impacts discussions.  T17: Amphibian Studies inn Reservoir Fluctuation Zone The second visits will be completed by November 8. These are being done in mostly riparian and stream areas above the drawdown zones. The drawdown zone amphibian studies will be conducted in the late winter/spring of 2002.  T11: Oregon Spotted Frog Inventory There will be a summary report this spring.  T13: Survey and Manage Terrestrial Mollusk Survey This study will start shortly. The survey crew is awaiting maps from Joetta. Tony will contact Joetta to remind her of the high priority around this study.  REVIEW UPDATED STUDY REQUESTS R-T16 Rare Plants Ann discussed the revisions she made to the scope of this study. She now suggests the areas be: <b7> Current and proposed dispersed recreation sites adjacent to the reservoir <b7> Proposed developed recreation sites within the project boundary <b7> All wetland areas hydrologically linked to the reservoir. Most of the existing developed sites have already been surveyed. The intention of this study is to survey every dispersed site that is project related. Surveyors would make their own determination according to protocol as to the area people are using associated with each study site. The surveyor could extend out the survey as suitable habitat was identified. The group approved this Study Request. It will move to the design phase after Ann distributes the final version to Tony. Hamer Environmental will draft the Study Plan with Ann before it is distributed to the Working Group for review.  R-T18 Breeding Birds After some discussion, we agreed to continue to discuss this study at our November meeting.
