They are going to meet again in a week re: terms of coming to agreement on how to handle confidentiality. Russ Busch, the attorney representing all three tribes, has submitted language around confidentiality. Their main concerns are protecting archeological sites, cultural practices (other than fishing) and related information. Most attorneys seem comfortable with what Russ proposes. Lloyd distributed Russ's outline for us to review. Lloyd also distributed the latest red-line version of the Confidentiality Section of the Process Document. The attorneys have not yet agreed on how to handle Section 4-2 : Procedures to Protect PSE Against Competitive Use of Collaborative Information. PSE's interest is to protect sensitive information during the interim period where a would-be competitor might be able to effectively use the information. PSE doesn't intend to exclude participants' access to information. It is the dissemination of critical information, e.g. financial, future plans, alternative analysis, that they are looking to control. PSE would enter into confidentiality agreements with Tribes, citizens and NGO participants. However, PSE's desire to not provide critical information to a competitor runs counter to how agencies operate in an open environment. Fred shared that USFWS was uncomfortable with how broadly this issue is being defined and that PSE would be the one determining what is confidential. It was pointed out that in the Grant County PUD case with PacifiCorp (the competitor) requesting information, it was a traditional process not an ALP. USFWS suggests that FERC determine on a case by case basis re: What is/is not confidential? Many felt that this was not a viable alternative, as FERC would not be able to respond in a timely fashion. It was felt that if FERC determined confidentiality, than PSE's option would be to not give agency folk the material. It was suggested that the Solution Team rather than PSE make the decision around what should be considered confidential. FERC could then arbitrate where needed (if the Solution Team couldn't agree). There is no legal precedent re: how to balance the Freedom of Information Act with confidentiality. The ALP calls for all information being open and transparent. It was suggested that we have been trying to draft "secretive" language into a process intended not to be secretive. If a Licensee wanted confidentiality, FERC's traditional process is used. FERC does allow a hybrid traditional process, where a draft environmental assessment and settlement agreement would be forwarded with the license application. NMFS also has trouble with setting a precedent that could be used in other NMFS activities across the nation. It was suggested that the scope of material that would be held confidential should be limited. It was suggested that PSE could provide a list of potentially confidential documents/information.  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 2/27/2002 MEETING NOTES Baker Solution Team FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 3   Our Options: <b7> Let attorneys continue <b7> Throw out confidentiality language and go ALP <b7> Go hybrid <b7> Go traditional <b7> Teamlet to resolve <b7> Work up a "Confidentiality Schedule" <b7> Gentlemen's Agreement Several NGO representatives expressed a desire to go ALP so that decisions would be made by this group rather than FERC. They also like the inclusive nature of the ALP and feared that they would not be as involved in a traditional process. After additional discussion, Ed Schild announced that PSE will take a week or so to do a risk assessment around possibly removing the confidentiality language from the Communications Protocol/Process Document. PSE may elect to go traditional (hybrid) if they need to protect themselves from a competitor. Stay tuned... FERC CONFERENCE CALL Keith Brooks and Steve Hocking from FERC were on the phone. We discussed confidentiality as reflected above. PROTOCOL TO BRING WORKING GROUP ISSUES TO SOLUTION TEAM FOR RESOLUTION Stan and Lyn revised the draft of this process since our February meeting. We reviewed and approved this process (with Bob Helton's suggested edits) for bringing Working Group issues to the Solution Team for resolution. SETTLEMENT PROCESS STRAWMAN Lloyd distributed a "strawman" draft of a collaborative process leading to recommendations for settlement. This draft uses interests as the driver to issue resolution. It was expressed that a process for resolving issues has been used successfully by other groups. A teamlet, consisting of Ed, Bruce, Lloyd, Stan, Jon, Rod, and Bob, will meet to work on a plan for the settlement process. DRAFT SCOPING DOCUMENT 1 Connie distributed this document and asked for comments by March 8, 2002. This is a preliminary draft of the full scoping document for the Environmental Assessment. The Working Groups are reviewing Part II regarding the resource specific issues. Connie will compile comments and send out another draft prior to the March 27 Solution Team meeting. This document supplements the Initial Consultation Document, which will be issued in March. Scoping Document 1 will be issued in April. A joint public meeting/scoping meeting will be held in May.
