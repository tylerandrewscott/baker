Andy—ask tribes about tribal enforcement policies (for 2.1.3—Law Enforcement) EDAW Cost Estimate Andy gave us a report on Chuck Everett’s (EDAW) review and comparison of the USFS and PSE’s cost estimates. In most cases he recommended using USFS costs recognizing that a decision on who will implement the various actions may effect costs. He also suggested that the Agency’s administrative percentage be looked at in different ways to bring down overall costs. This work showed that there is no “silver bullet” to reduce costs. PME Teamlet Recommendations Andy, Ann and Saul walked us through the Teamlet discussion of 12/19/04. The Teamlet was able to trim the package from $43 million to $27 million in PSE exposure. PSE and Skagit County met yesterday regarding the Lake Shannon PME. Jon and Ed et al are meeting today as a policy team to review the teamlet’s recommendations also. The purpose of our discussion today is to make sure that the working group is okay with the teamlet’s recommendations and to make suggestions, if they come up, for cost reduction. As we walked through the recommendations, working group members raised their questions and concerns. Regarding dispersed sites (2.2.1), the group discussed how the monitoring of dispersed sites would need to be fleshed out as part of the discussion when we put together a Recreation Management Plan. Regarding New Trails O & M (Phase 1—2.4.2c), we decided to move this to 2.4.1a, so that New Trails PME includes both construction and maintenance. Regarding Lake Shannon (2.5.3), Brian noted a concern that the O & M amount is not sufficient. The County would also prefer a paved boat launch (rather than gravel) but believe that the cost difference between the two might be covered in another way. Regarding Kulshan (2.5.4), Ann registered a concern that costs are still a hair high. Andy noted that historic O & M costs have actually been higher than shown on the Teamlet spreadsheet. Regarding Wildlife Observation (2.5.6), the Teamlet reduced the scope. We discussed how this new Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Recreation Resources Working Group Page 2 of 3   scope could be used as seed money for a grant proposal and/or to do something limited in scope and use the RAM Fund to do additional wildlife observation opportunities. The group discussed the budget for Information, Interpretation and Education PME’s, noting the benefits of these PME’s to other groups. We should present this to the Solution Team. Regarding Stewardship (6.5.3), the group discussed the need to flesh this out and to integrate 6.5.1, 6.5.2 and 6.5.3. We will work on this when we re-draft the PME’s (and will update this integration on the PME Status summary sheet and the prioritization Teamlet 12/19/03 spreadsheet). Regarding Park & Boulder Campground decommissioning, the group noted that this action is driven by terrestrial and aquatic interests, not by recreation interests. Conclusion The group recommends this proposal (Teamlet recommendation of 12/19/03 as updated today) with the acknowledgement that PSE still has concerns about the cost exposure of the total package. We believe this proposal represents excellent progress and collaboration among working group members. Studies Update Andy handed out an update of studies. He explained that Chris Lawson will send R 12 and 13 first, followed by R 11/15 and 16. These studies reports are projected to be finalized by late January. Regarding R 5 (Aesthetics/Visual Survey), Mark Greenig answered questions and received some feedback from working group members. Overall, the group members who had reviewed the draft were very complimentary about Mark’s efforts. Tentative Agenda for 1/26/04 Meeting: USGFS Mt.
