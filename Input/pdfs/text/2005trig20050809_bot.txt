Set date and agenda for next meeting Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 TRIG botanical teamlet meeting, August 9, 2005  Page 1 of 3   New Action Items Tony will inform TRIG members of the need to reschedule the September 9 meeting to September 23. Kathy will provide copies of todayâ€™s meeting handouts on weeds to Laurel Shiner. Kathy will prepare a decision matrix to use in developing the management objectives for individual weed sites. The matrix will provide a link between the species priority categories, the site priority categories, and the 5 year management goals for each site. Kathy will clarify discussion of the annual review and update of the target weed species list and how new species are prioritized within the IWMP. Laura will prepare a crosswalk of PSE ID codes with USFS ID codes for weed sites. Report on old Action Items Tony will provide photos of the FSC anchor point sites when possible, to complete a Project Initiation Form for the site. This will provide a test of the form, and a sample completed form that can be provided to others as an example of the level of detail needed. Tony and Kathy drafted a recommendation for language re acquisition of new parcels to be used in the IWMP; this draft language is an agenda item for discussion with Carl Corey and/or Don Gay of the USFS during the September 23, 2005 TRIG meeting. Laura provided a sighting report for the Little Park Creek Schistostega site. Meeting Discussion Article 508: The team reviewed the revised prioritization scheme for all species (revised to reflect comments from the 7/20/05 TRIG meeting). The IWMP section regarding newly acquired parcels will require further discussion between PSE and Don Gay, Carl Corey, and other interested parties; this is scheduled to occur at the September 23, 2005 TRIG meeting. Kathy presented revised drafts of the English ivy and tansy ragwort management plans and first versions of the Scotch broom and wild carrot plans. The site prioritization scheme, and draft 5-yr management objectives for the sites were reviewed. It was agreed that Kathy would clarify language in the IWMP regarding annual review of the target weed species list, and the prioritization process for new species added to the list. Also, Kathy will prepare a decision matrix showing how the species and site priorities relate to the 5 yr management objectives. Article 509: The updated Project Initiation form will be tested on the FSC site. Tony will provide photos of the anchor points and other information needed to fill out the form. The SSPMP outline was reviewed and discussed. Site-specific draft plans for Usnea longissima, Schistostega pennata, and Peltigera pacifica were reviewed and discussed. It was agreed that sites where the presence of the sensitive species could not be confirmed would be managed by monitoring only. If the species is documented in the future, protection measures would be developed and implemented. Other Items: Laura is planning to meet the head of the FS road crew at the Chadwick Creek borrow pit site on August 17. Kathy will go along and they will complete a rare plant sighting form, confirm or modify the Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 TRIG botanical teamlet meeting, August 9, 2005  Page 2 of 3   proposed management measures for the site.
