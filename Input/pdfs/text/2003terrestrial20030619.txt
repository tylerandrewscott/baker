We will primarily document agreements and action items. RESOLVE Groundrules and Criteria Dee suggested—and the group agreed to—the following groundrules: • • • • • • •  Work at understanding one another. Use airtime wisely. Speak honestly and respectfully. Examine assumptions. Make tentative agreements, then look at the whole package together. One meeting review rule: we have one meeting to review and change the tentative agreements of the previous RESOLVE session.1 Document our agreements.  Dee also suggested the following criteria to determine acceptable solutions to an issue under discussion: • • • •  It (the solution) helps us meet our interests. It’s legal. It doesn’t create other problems. It is practical, do-able.  The group seemed to think that these criteria were reasonable and noted that others might come up as discussions continued. Also, group members noted that some good solutions might create other problems and that this criterion would have to be looked at as a kind of “soft” constraint. 1.3.1—Osprey Nest Structures Agreements 1. The goal of this PME is to provide safe nesting for osprey on Lake Shannon. 2. The measurable objectives of this PME are to: a. Provide and maintain 10 structures; and b. If possible transfer these structures to natural sites. 3. This PME is subject to adaptive management by the technical implementation group (BRCC or other name so long as technical experts are working on things). The purpose of adaptive management is to achieve the goal. Adaptive management does not change the goal. 4. With these changes, the group is in tentative agreement on 1.3.1. 1  All agreements are tentative even after the “one meeting review rule”. However, the one meeting rule gives regular participants an opportunity to bring an agreement back to the table while assuring that tentative agreements are not forever reopened. It also accommodates regular participants who must miss a meeting and may want to weigh in on a decision. The group also agreed that materials to be considered at the RESOLVE session would be sent out in advance, per regular working group rules, if group members were expected to attempt agreement on those materials.
