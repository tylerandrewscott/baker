Evaluate meeting  REPORT ON OLD ACTION ITEMS <b7> Don reserved the conference room at Mountlake Terrace location for first few months of 2001. CAUCUS REPORT Stakeholders (without PSE and the Facilitator) met for the first hour and half of the meeting to create a list of interests. They made a lot of progress on interests. They requested using the entire November 21, meeting time to finalize the interests. USE OF CONSULTANTS Tony explained PSE's current use of Biota Pacifica & Hamer Environmental. Since studies have not yet been defined, it is difficult to say exactly what type of work they will be doing. Where appropriate, they will sub contract to technical experts. There was discussion over the role of Biota Pacific. Marty explained that his role is not as PSE's advocate. He advocates for the process, making sure that decisions are made by facts and data to ensure the credibility of the working group recommendations. (Team Leader Note: Marty is serving not just as an advisor to PSE, but is also assisting PSE in developing a creative and credible approach to terrestrial resource issues that is acceptable to the Working Group, the Solution Team, and ultimately the FERC). The question was raised about team member access to consultants. It was suggested that a fair and consistent approach might be for PSE to hire one large consulting firm with expertise in the various resource areas. The continuity provided by that approach would be beneficial. Team members have to date had no voice in selection of consultants. There was consensus that the working group should drive the study process. (Team Leader Note: after the meeting, members of the group suggested that we didn't have complete consensus, and that we need to discuss the use of consultants and the study process further in upcoming meetings). Tony mentioned that PSE has certain studies that they would conduct regardless  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 10/17/2000 MEETING NOTES L Wiltse for Terrestrial Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 2 of 5   of working group input, since the studies are needed to provide information required for development of licensing documents. There is a potential need for consultants to research issues off-line and come back to the Team with a "White Paper." This is a role that Hamer environmental would fill. Hamer environmental has been retained by PSE to prepare study plans and potentially to act as the consultant overseeing implementation of studies. Biota Pacific serves as a technical support to PSE and the working group. Team members have access to consultants. The team expressed discomfort over the consultant they use to develop studies also advising PSE. PSE STUDIES UPDATE: Tony described PSE's budgeting process. They have proposed the 2001 budget to the PSE Budget Committee. The Committee will accept/reject the budget by the end of the year. Tony should have a good idea of what amount of funding will be available for 2001. He will share which studies will likely be approved for funding at the December 5th meeting.  ISSUES/INTERESTS  Wildlife & Terrestrial Resources Working Group 1. Noxious (non-native) Species <ad> characterize problem (need more information on what and where) Interest (1) <ad> Non-native species can out compete/displace native species and change processes in the ecosystem or habitat. Issue (2) <ad> Fear of extinction of certain plant/animal species. Interest (3) <ad> Non-native species/potential for non-native species exists in the vicinity of the Baker River Project. Issue <ad> Determine Baker River Project contribution to the invasion of non-native species in the area. Issue (2) <ad> Controlling/eliminating non-native species in the vicinity of the Baker River Project. 2. Loss of rare plant habitat Issue (1) - Maintaining and restoring rare plants and their habitats in the Basin Interest (2) - We may have lost rare plants/have lost rare plant habitats or we may lose them in the future 3. Wetland, riparian habitats (ecosystem process) Issue (1) <ad> Reservoir (rather than river) disrupts plant dispersal and plant community dynamics Interest (2) <ad> Protecting, maintaining and enhancing wetland and riparian functions (plant & animal) 4. Inundation habitat loss <ad> wetlands, riparian, deer & elk winter range (e.g. Oregon spotted frog) Issue (1) <ad> Project operation/fluctuation of reservoir Issue (2) <ad> Continued loss of habitats inundated by reservoirs. Direct loss of previous habitat Issue (3) <ad> Importance of low gradient/low elevation riparian habitat inundated by continued existence of hydropower project: <b7> Effects to low elevation grizzly bear spring foraging habitat. <b7> Effects on forest carnivore habitat (e.g. fisher, wolverine, cougar, lynx). <b7> Effects on resident and neo tropical migrant songbirds habitat (specifically species dependent on cottonwood overstory and willow shrub habitats).
