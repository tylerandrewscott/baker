Team members brainstormed the following parties whose participation would help the team accomplish its stated mission. Team members volunteered to contact people they know in each of the organizations to invite them to participate in this process. <b7> Skagit County (especially flood control and recreation) (Jerry) <b7> Skagit Council of Governments (Rod) <b7> City of Mt. Vernon (Jerry) <b7> City of Burlington (Jerry) <b7> All local governments (Jerry) <b7> Audubon Society (Patrick) <b7> Sierra Club (Patrick) <b7> Wilderness Society (Patrick) <b7> Focus (Patrick) <b7> Property Owners (such as Crown Pacific, Longview Fibre, Lone Star) (PSE) <b7> River user groups <b7> Recreation users of reservoir PSE shared what they had done to date regarding informing interested parties of progress in the relicensing process.

BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 12/13/2000 MEETING NOTES Baker Solution Team FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 6   Interests of the Department of Ecology (Rod Sakrison) The State of Washington Department of Ecology (Ecology) represents the following interests in the Baker Project Relicense: Ecology is the agency created to administer the State of Washington's water management program, including its comprehensive water quality and water resource allocation programs, and to present the views and recommendations of the State regarding any federal license or permit relating thereto at any proceeding, negotiation, or hearing in such regard conducted by the federal government. RCW 43.21A.020 [Department of Ecology], RCW 43.27A.090 [Water Resources], RCW 90.03.010 [Water Code <ad> 1917 Act], RCW 90.54.010 [Water Resources Act of 1971], and RCW 90.58.010 [Shoreline Management Act of 1971]. Ecology also has statutory responsibilities in the matters of flood control, shoreline and coastal zone management, coordination and permit issuance pursuant to the federal water pollution control act amendments, and environmental review and coordination, pursuant to the State's environmental policy statute. Chapter 86.16 RCW [Flood Plain Management]; Chapter 90.48 RCW [Water Pollution Control Act]; Chapter 90.58 RCW [Shoreline Management Act of 1971] and Chapter 43.21C RCW [State Environmental Policy Act]. Puget Sound Energy has requested relicensing of its Baker Project on the Baker River, a tributary of the Skagit River in Skagit and Whatcom counties. Continued hydropower generation operation at the Baker Project affects the flow of water from the Baker River to the Skagit River, a river with listings under the Endangered Species Act. Relicense of the Baker Project obviously has, at a minimum, implications for water quality, fish, and other environmental issues. As such, involvement by Ecology is critical given its statutory obligations. A withdrawal of water for storage and withdrawal for electrical power generation also affects Ecology's permitting authority for water quantity decisions. Finally, to the extent this project may involve a discharge into the nation's waters and requires a federal permit or license, a water quality certification pursuant to Section 401 of the Clean Water Act is required. In view of the issues raised regarding water quality, water quantity, fishery resources and other environmental matters involving state policies, Ecology has a direct interest that may be directly affected by the outcome of the relicensing proceeding. In many of these interests Ecology has exclusive authority and any other party in the proceeding does not adequately represent the interests of the Department of Ecology. In addition, Ecology represents the public interest in these matters. Interests of a Citizen (Bob Helton) Reasons for participating in the Baker River Project Relicensing ALP Process as a private interested citizen and PSE customer: To help arrive at a reasonable cost of accommodation for using the Baker River watershed and river for the production of electrical power by PSE regarding the relicensing criteria for production of hydropower at the Baker River Project. The costs of accommodation may include, but not be limited to, environmental mitigation, fish run protection and propagation of aquatic species over the proposed term of the relicensing period.  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 12/13/2000 MEETING NOTES Baker Solution Team FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 7   Interests of National Marine Fisheries Service (Steve Fransen) Conserve public trust living marine resources and provide sustainable treaty, recreational, and commercial fisheries. Interests of Town of Concrete (Paul Schissler) To protect and improve the quality of life and economy of the Town of Concrete and its citizens. <b7> Allow the continued operation of municipal wastewater treatment facility on Baker River, upgraded to accommodate growth and to meet renewed NPDES permit. <b7> Help, not hinder, the Town of Concrete community economic revitalization as: Upriver hub for goods and services, job center for natural resource and technology employment, and base camp for regional tourism and eco-tourism (three-pronged economic development strategy). <b7> Catalog, archive and display historical information and artifacts related to Baker River and nearby natural and human history (Concrete Museum) <b7> Protect, restore and showcase cultural and historical resources and sites associated with Baker River, including National Historic Register sites (Thompson Bridge, Baker River Hydroelectric Works) and potential National Historic Register sites (Concrete Historic District) <b7> Comply with federal cultural resource laws and regulations. <b7> Educate youth as present and future citizens who value and protect water quality and all species. <b7> Plan and implement education/interpretation/outreach programs that complement the efforts of the Concrete School District focus on these issues. <b7> Continue to explore feasibility of the Little Baker River Channel Restoration Project. <b7> Include Town as a major node and service center in the network of recreational facilities and linkages surrounding the Baker River, including hiking, camping, boating, etc. <b7> Develop master plan for recreation and open space aesthetics along Baker River within the Town of Concrete and nearby. <b7> Provide socioeconomic support for the Town of Concrete.  Draft interest statements for North Cascades National Park Service Complex and InterAgency Committee for Outdoor Recreation were distributed. They will be discussed (with representatives in attendance) at the January meeting.  COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOL  The team postponed review of the Communications Protocol (dated December 4, 2000) until the next meeting. Copies of the draft Protocol and the comment table were available.  PROCESS DOCUMENT  The draft Process Document is being reviewed internally by PSE and will be sent out to the team for review prior to the January meeting.
