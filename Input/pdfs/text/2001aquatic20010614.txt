NEW ACTION ITEMS <b7> Arnie: By 6/15 send out email reminder to team members re: all study-related action items and their due dates. <b7> ALL: Send study-related comments directly to Sue (R-2) and copy Phil, Arnie, and Nick. <b7> ALL: (especially Stan): Get any available fish spawning habitat information (supports A-1B study plan development) to Sue by June 25, or call R-2 (They will pick up!) <b7> ALL: Get Sue your feedback on Study Plan A-1C by June 25. <b7> ALL: Get comments to Sue on A-24 by 6/29. <b7> ALL: Get reservoir fish population data (supports A-03 study plan development) to Sue at earliest convenience. <b7> Chuck: Summarize A-10 data by September meeting. <b7> Brady and Others: Get Sue input for A-20 by 6/29. <b7> Tony: Send map data to Don. <b7> Fred: Talk with Terrestrial Group re: wetlands that are hydrologically but not directly connected to the river. <b7> Sue: Put together a one page summary of Type A vs. Type B data measurements/methods by 6/25. <b7> Nick: Set up a conference call to get direction on level of survey (Type A/B) for A-1a. <b7> Don: Provide information on cutthroat passage through Cascades to Arnie by June 25. <b7> Bob: Summarize current water quality data (by August 9 meeting) <b7> Nick: Coordinate with Forest Service re: A-13 REPORT ON OLD ACTION ITEMS <b7> Chuck notified team members when delta field survey took place. Sue accompanied him. <b7> Tony Fuchs reported that PSE is working toward making GIS the medium for their mapping. They are doing a digital terrain model for the reservoir fluctuation zone, in 5 ft. contour intervals. They are using digital topographical information to depict the FERC boundary. PSE is also working with Walker & Associates to create digital ortho photos (from a fly over in 1999). These show everything within the FERC boundary plus 100 meters out. Upper portions of tributaries are not included. There would have to be additional aerial photo  Baker River Project Relicense Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 6.14.01_fishwg_notes; Lyn Wiltse  2 of 6   flights to capture these portions of tributaries. There was a request to have the relic Little Baker included in the area of study. Anyone wanting access to the data relating to the GIS map can make requests to Tony Fuchs at PSE : 425-462-3553. Reminder: these are all still in draft form. <b7> Rod: Met with PSE to come up with spill protocol. <b7> Arnie: Re-sent the most current version of A-2 for review. <b7> Brady: Invited Jim Chu to do presentation on Wild & Scenic River at July meeting. He is available. <b7> R-2: Completed Task 1 of R-A01.A by June 30. STUDY REQUEST SUBMITTALS/STUDY PLAN DEVELOPMENT  Study #  Title  A01.A Reservoir Tributary Habitat Surveys  A01.B Reservoir Tributary Biological Surveys  A01.C Reservoir Tributary Delta Surveys  A02 A03 A04 A09 A24:  LB River Habitat Mapping Reservoir Fish Population Characteristics LB/Skagit River Flow, Gaging Skagit River Flow and Habitat Assessment (HIGH PRIORITY) Hydrologic and Geomorphic Analysis  Notes/Next Steps Defer to conference call (decide Type A/B data measurements/methods) Need additional information re: spawning habitats from team members. Get to Arnie by June 25. R-2 will bring map to supplement discussion on 7/12. Distributed study plan and asked for team member feedback by 6/25. This study would address access (passage concerns from head cutting) and sub-surface flow. They hope to do these surveys this year. The group agreed to go ahead with the survey. Need available information from team members so can determine scope of survey. Moving ahead (distributed gage location map). Looking at flows, sediment transport. Will be looking at large woody debris. Will put together a study plan for A-20. Distributed study plan for A24 for comments. Get comments to Sue by 6/29. Sue reported they have some synthesized, unregulated data already. Will have comparison of flows: managed vs. unmanaged and an overall channel network analysis.  Baker River Project Relicense Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 6.14.01_fishwg_notes; Lyn Wiltse  3 of 6   A05 Water Quality Sampling  Plan still pending. Still considering data  collection methods. Need to identify critical  path for sampling fecal coliform. This study  ties to water quality certification required for  license.  A06 UB Passage Design Baffle Modification Completed May 25. Got in 2 weeks of study.  A08 UB Passage System Evaluation  The study is incomplete due to trouble raising  the gates during early trial. Study is ongoing.  Data from this preliminary study will help us  set up a complete study in 2002. Will see  summarized data in August.  A07 Lower Baker Forebay Bathymetric  Will be done summer of 2001.  Survey  A10 Baker River Delta Habitat Assessment- On May 10, Chuck, Sue and Doug (at elevation  Char  of 705 ft.) surveyed passage capability at  tributary mouths. In general, they found no  passage problems. Chuck will survey on June  15 to get full pool data.  A11 Nutrient Addition  Parking Lot- not for 2001.  A12 Instream Flows for Biodiversity  Parked until 2002 and beyond.  A13 Water Quality Assessment  Keep separate from A05.  A14 Reservoir Shoreline Erosion  Not for 2001-Needs further development.  A15 UB Delta Scour  Draft Study Plan is going through internal  review at R-2.  A16 Lower Baker Delta/Channelization  Pending <ad> Not for 2001.  A17 Tributaries Surveys Upstream of  Coordinate methodology with A01.  Barriers  A18 Baker River Survey Upstream of 1 km. Merged into A-1A.  A19 Review Limnological Information  Preview in August  A20 Large Woody Debris Management A21 Skagit Wild & Scenic River Values A22 Baker Lake Trout Impacts Evaluation A23 Baker River Wild & Scenic River Values A24 Hydrologic and Geomorphic Analysis  Will begin drafting plan in August. Welcome input. Review Study Request for discussion at July meeting. Review Study Request for approval at July 12 meeting. Get comments to Nick. Review Study Request for discussion at July 12 mtg. Study Plan distributed for comments. Comments due to Sue by 6/29.  BRADY'S PRESENTATION ON FEDERAL WATERSHED ANALYSIS Brady Green walked the group through the purpose and content of the Federal Watershed Analysis. His power point presentation is available on the Puget Web Site. This is a working  Baker River Project Relicense Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 6.14.01_fishwg_notes; Lyn Wiltse  4 of 6   document. Contributors will be asked to give feedback on the draft due to be distributed in July. The "final" version will be available to the public this fall.  UPDATE ON PSE OPERATIONS MODEL Bob Barnes reported that they are on schedule for beta testing in August. They anticipate having the final product by the end of September. The model may not be able to explicitly deal with data needs relating to various resource areas. The model will be able to show different stage heights. It lacks an optimization function relating to specific resources. It will optimize under any scenario for power.  LIST OF MEETING HANDOUTS <b7> R-2 Consultants - Table 1.
