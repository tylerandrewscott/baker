NEW ACTION ITEMS ! Arnie: By 6/15 send out email reminder to team members re: all study-related action items and their due dates. ! ALL: Send study-related comments directly to Sue (R-2) and copy Phil, Arnie, and Nick. ! ALL: (especially Stan): Get any available fish spawning habitat information (supports A-1B study plan development) to Sue by June 25, or call R-2 (They will pick up!) ! ALL: Get Sue your feedback on Study Plan A-1C by June 25. ! ALL: Get comments to Sue on A-24 by 6/29. ! ALL: Get reservoir fish population data (supports A-03 study plan development) to Sue at earliest convenience. ! Chuck: Summarize A-10 data by September meeting. ! Brady and Others: Get Sue input for A-20 by 6/29. ! Tony: Send map data to Don. ! Fred: Talk with Terrestrial Group re: wetlands that are hydrologically but not directly connected to the river. ! Sue: Put together a one page summary of Type A vs. Type B data measurements/methods by 6/25. ! Nick: Set up a conference call to get direction on level of survey (Type A/B) for A-1a. ! Don: Provide information on cutthroat passage through Cascades to Arnie by June 25. ! Bob: Summarize current water quality data (by August 9 meeting) ! Nick: Coordinate with Forest Service re: A-13 REPORT ON OLD ACTION ITEMS ! Chuck notified team members when delta field survey took place. Sue accompanied him. ! Tony Fuchs reported that PSE is working toward making GIS the medium for their mapping. They are doing a digital terrain model for the reservoir fluctuation zone, in 5 ft. contour intervals. They are using digital topographical information to depict the FERC boundary. PSE is also working with Walker & Associates to create digital ortho photos (from a fly over in 1999). These show everything within the FERC boundary plus 100 meters out. Upper portions of tributaries are not included. There would have to be additional aerial photo Baker River Project Relicense 2 of 6 Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 6.14.01_fishwg_notes; Lyn Wiltse flights to capture these portions of tributaries. There was a request to have the relic Little Baker included in the area of study. Anyone wanting access to the data relating to the GIS map can make requests to Tony Fuchs at PSE : 425-462-3553. Reminder: these are all still in draft form. ! Rod: Met with PSE to come up with spill protocol. ! Arnie: Re-sent the most current version of A-2 for review. ! Brady: Invited Jim Chu to do presentation on Wild & Scenic River at July meeting. He is available. ! R-2: Completed Task 1 of R-A01.A by June 30. STUDY REQUEST SUBMITTALS/STUDY PLAN DEVELOPMENT Study # Title Notes/Next Steps A01.A Reservoir Tributary Habitat Surveys Defer to conference call (decide Type A/B data measurements/methods) A01.B Reservoir Tributary Biological Surveys Need additional information re: spawning habitats from team members. Get to Arnie by June 25. R-2 will bring map to supplement discussion on 7/12. A01.C Reservoir Tributary Delta Surveys Distributed study plan and asked for team member feedback by 6/25. This study would address access (passage concerns from head cutting) and sub-surface flow. They hope to do these surveys this year. A02 LB River Habitat Mapping The group agreed to go ahead with the survey. A03 Reservoir Fish Population Need available information from team Characteristics members so can determine scope of survey. A04 LB/Skagit River Flow, Gaging Moving ahead (distributed gage location map). A09 Skagit River Flow and Habitat Looking at flows, sediment transport. Will be Assessment (HIGH PRIORITY) looking at large woody debris. Will put A24: Hydrologic and Geomorphic Analysis together a study plan for A-20. Distributed study plan for A24 for comments. Get comments to Sue by 6/29. Sue reported they have some synthesized, unregulated data already. Will have comparison of flows: managed vs. unmanaged and an overall channel network analysis. Baker River Project Relicense 3 of 6 Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 6.14.01_fishwg_notes; Lyn Wiltse A05 Water Quality Sampling Plan still pending. Still considering data collection methods. Need to identify critical path for sampling fecal coliform. This study ties to water quality certification required for license. A06 UB Passage Design Baffle Modification Completed May 25. Got in 2 weeks of study. A08 UB Passage System Evaluation The study is incomplete due to trouble raising the gates during early trial. Study is ongoing. Data from this preliminary study will help us set up a complete study in 2002. Will see summarized data in August. A07 Lower Baker Forebay Bathymetric Will be done summer of 2001. Survey A10 Baker River Delta Habitat Assessment- On May 10, Chuck, Sue and Doug (at elevation Char of 705 ft.) surveyed passage capability at tributary mouths. In general, they found no passage problems. Chuck will survey on June 15 to get full pool data. A11 Nutrient Addition Parking Lot- not for 2001. A12 Instream Flows for Biodiversity Parked until 2002 and beyond. A13 Water Quality Assessment Keep separate from A05. A14 Reservoir Shoreline Erosion Not for 2001-Needs further development. A15 UB Delta Scour Draft Study Plan is going through internal review at R-2. A16 Lower Baker Delta/Channelization Pending – Not for 2001. A17 Tributaries Surveys Upstream of Coordinate methodology with A01. Barriers A18 Baker River Survey Upstream of 1 km. Merged into A-1A. A19 Review Limnological Information Preview in August A20 Large Woody Debris Management Will begin drafting plan in August. Welcome input. A21 Skagit Wild & Scenic River Values Review Study Request for discussion at July meeting. A22 Baker Lake Trout Impacts Evaluation Review Study Request for approval at July 12 meeting. Get comments to Nick. A23 Baker River Wild & Scenic River Review Study Request for discussion at July 12 Values mtg. A24 Hydrologic and Geomorphic Analysis Study Plan distributed for comments. Comments due to Sue by 6/29. BRADY’S PRESENTATION ON FEDERAL WATERSHED ANALYSIS Brady Green walked the group through the purpose and content of the Federal Watershed Analysis. His power point presentation is available on the Puget Web Site. This is a working Baker River Project Relicense 4 of 6 Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 6.14.01_fishwg_notes; Lyn Wiltse document. Contributors will be asked to give feedback on the draft due to be distributed in July. The “final” version will be available to the public this fall. UPDATE ON PSE OPERATIONS MODEL Bob Barnes reported that they are on schedule for beta testing in August. They anticipate having the final product by the end of September. The model may not be able to explicitly deal with data needs relating to various resource areas. The model will be able to show different stage heights. It lacks an optimization function relating to specific resources. It will optimize under any scenario for power. LIST OF MEETING HANDOUTS ! R-2 Consultants - Table 1.
