QUOTES OF THE DAY There were a couple of them!  FISH PASSAGE TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP REPORT This group met December 3rd and 4th, 2003. The first day, they came to consensus on design criteria for the Floating Surface Collector (FSC). Design criteria will be developed for the replacement guide net and transition structure scheduled for installation in March 2004. They also finished up the characteristics of stress relief ponds. They are developing a numerical model for reservoir forebay hydraulics.  The second day, they reviewed the overall schedule, especially the construction sequencing of the Floating Surface Collectors at Upper Baker and Lower Baker. They agreed to shift construction of Lower Baker by eleven months to allow for time to incorporate learnings from the installation at Upper Baker. They also finished up the wording for PMEs around the stress relief ponds. They made good progress on definition of performance standards, particularly the reasonable progress sequence.

No further activity at this point. See A01a. See A01a. (The draft report is close to being out.) Not discussed. Existing information was reviewed for the PDEA. Incorporated into A9a. ACTIVE Nothing new to report. Complete. Complete. Complete. The Instream Flows Teamlet met November 17. Recommendations of that group to this group were as follows (for a detailed outline of their recommendations, see their meeting notes): <b7> Made minor changes to transect weightings <b7> Set the critical ramping flow at 30Kcfs. <b7> Made some changes in analysis: <b7> Number of excursions and WDFW ramping <b7> How to look at varial zones (from 12 hrs. to 7 days). <b7> Spawning de-watering index <b7> Spawning <b7> Weighted usable area vs. discharge relationships.(examples of daily habitat models) This teamlet will meet again to continue these discussions on December 15. Re: Reservoir refill. Phil pointed out the graphs and tables produced to show how quickly the reservoir can be refilled and how different refill scenarios would affect the euphotic zone volume on a month-by-month basis. All were asked to consider if they want to use these data and if so, what weighting factors may be appropriate. We will continue this discussion at the In stream Flows meeting on Monday. Did not discuss at this meeting. Nothing new to report. ACTIVE.

Phil reported that the current turbid conditions are not suitable for spawning surveys. Stan suggested that we conduct a high-level survey at known high-density sites. We agreed to do this between now and the end of the year. We are also looking at peak spawning areas, by cell, by transect, by species. Did not discuss at this meeting. Nothing new to report. ACTIVE. Complete. Tie to A26. Split between R-A21 & R-A09. Removed from list of studies this group will address. Removed from list of studies we will address. Sue and Doug ground truthed these sites since the last meeting. The final draft report was sent out November 13th. All were asked to, by December 19, send your comments to Arnie on the erosion memo that Sue drafted to Greta. Did not discuss at this meeting. ACTIVE Mike Ramey of R2 walked us through a presentation outlining the costs, benefits, and disadvantages associated with various alternatives. Arn suggested we might want to focus on the Little Baker and not the mainstem. Chuck expressed doubt that the USACE could fund Option A. Below is a summary of the report findings: Summary of Spawning Habitat Alternative A <b7> Cost would be $3.8MM capital cost and $385K annual cost <b7> Would provide restoration of natural habitat features <b7> Would negatively impact barrier dam, power production, be susceptible to flow fluctuations; would require frequent replenishment, may impact flooding <b7> 44,000 yards of fill would be needed <b7> Velocities and depths acceptable over wide range of flows <b7> Would need to replace upper layer of gravel approx. every other year  Baker River Project Relicense Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File:12:11:03; Lyn Wiltse  4 of 8   Baker River Project Relicense Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File:12:11:03; Lyn Wiltse  <b7> 2-3 feet reduction in barrier height at fish facilities <b7> Would not provide water source to Little Baker River channel Summary of Alternative B: LWD & Boulder Clusters <b7> Cost would be $230K capital cost and $7K annual cost <b7> Would increase habitat complexity and improved holding habitat <b7> 2500 feet total approx. length <b7> Assume 1 LWD and 1 Rock Structure per 100 ft of channel <b7> 25 anchored LWD structures within reach <b7> 25 rock structures within reach Summary of Alternative C: Skagit River Backwater Slough <b7> Cost would be $50K capital cost and $10K annual cost <b7> Would provide low flow juvenile habitat that is scarce in that section of the Middle Skagit <b7> Would provide periodic reconstruction Alternative Options to Provide Water Source to Little Baker: 1a: Little Baker Water Supply <ad> Elevate Lower Baker Channel <b7> Cost of Alternate Objective 1a would be $2.4MM capital cost and $140K annual cost <b7> Use 13k yd3 course fill to get the water level high enough to supply Little Baker <b7> Would negatively impact the barrier dam, power production, and possibly flooding 1b: Little Baker Water Supply <ad> From Barrier Dam <b7> Cost of Alternate Objective 1b would be $1.75MM capital cost and $35K annual cost <b7> May cause migration delays Next Steps: The USACE will continue to evaluate their proposed options, which are similar to 1a and 1b. Working Group members will discuss these options with their policy-level folks. We also agreed to have R2 flesh out this report so it exists as a stand-alone document that will support our decision downstream. This will include a coarse analysis of the biological impacts of each 5 of 8   A17 Tributaries Surveys Upstream of Barriers A18 Baker River Survey Upstream of 1 km.

R2 will also meet with the Upper Skagit Tribe re: Option B. We'll get an update on all this at our January 8, 2004 meeting. Scott will look into this to see if there is energy to pursue it. Merged into A01a and A01b. This study has been combined with A26a. Complete. This is being addressed by A9 and A24. Cancelled when non-native trout stocking in the reservoirs was discontinued. This is being addressed through A15. Sue reported that the hydrology portion of this report is complete. Addenda to the report were updated to reflect the datum shift and the shorter period of record to reflect current operations. Sue walked us through a table she put together suggesting various scenarios for inclusion as addenda to the final report, which she expects to get out by year-end. Not discussed at this meeting.

The draft final Study Plan was distributed, along with a status report on 2003 field activities. This will guide our 2004 actions. We need to be thinking about how we define gene pools. Scott reported that he and Ruth are working on blending this into the connectivity PME.  BAKER INTERIM PROTECTION PLAN (IPP) There was a meeting on November 20 with the Services re: the Interim Protection Plan. They discussed an operational on/off scenario, with one hour in between, with amplitude of 4K cfs (approximately 4K to 400 cfs). Phil and Cary are putting together a protocol for this. Testing of this scenario will take place January 14 and 15th. We will stay tuned...  REPORT ON OLD ACTION ITEMS <b7> Phil: Came up with a set of questions for folks to consider to prime the discussion of varial zones and ramping at the last Instream Flows Meeting. <b7> ALL: Reviewed Phil's questions to consider what appropriate statistics might be to measure ramping and varial zones and gave Phil your suggestions prior to the next meeting. <b7> Lorna: Saw that Phil got a copy of the recently issued "Limiting Factors Report". <b7> Sue: Copied all on our response to Greta's request for the Aquatic Resource erosion concerns. <b7> ALL: Let Sue know if you had any other erosion concerns from an aquatic resource perspective. <b7> ALL: Let Lorna know if you had questions re: Skagit County position on using Lake Shannon for flood control. <b7> Stan: Emailed two new PMEs to Arnie to distribute to working group members. <b7> Sue: Presented results of progress on Phase 2 of A16 at the December meeting.
