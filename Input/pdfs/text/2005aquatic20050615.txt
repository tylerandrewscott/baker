Evaluate meeting BAKER RIVER COMMITTEE OPERATIONS TOPICS Juvenile Fish Passage Migration Update Arnie walked the group through the “Baker Project Juvenile Fish Trap and Haul Results - Draft” handout. Total juvenile fish passage through Upper Baker so far has passed 144,000 and 7,700 at Lower Baker for a total of 151,000. The migration will continue through the end of July and early August. Tables were also distributed on daily counts and mark-recapture rates from reservoir study groups. Recapture rates at Upper Baker range from 54-58 percent for coho and 32 percent for sockeye and 30 percent for coho at Lower Baker. PSE has been picking up the operations of the Little Park Creek smolt collection trap in recent years. LPC smolt trapping operations will end for the season, June 15th. Final season totals will be reported at the next Aquatic Resources Group meeting. Gary reported that age of juvenile sockeye migrants examined from 2005 scale samples indicate a data trend back to younger fish of age 1-3.

A total of 1.6 million fry were counted out of Beach 4. Fry production operations at Beach 4 concluded May 23rd and the beach was drained for annual maintenance. Repairs were made on the curtain between Sections C and D to correct delamination. Additional maintenance will be made next year. The counter at Beach C failed early on and was switched with the counter from Beach A. The counters are all going to be sent back for calibration and repair. The beach has been watered back up for the next season of operation. Kevin reported that the dye test performed on June 11th, to check on the dispersion of water in the under gravel pipes throughout the gravel beds, went very well and had excellent dispersion (Kevin has a CD-ROM of the results for anyone interested). This is the second year in a row that the 1,200 adults loaded into Beach C has yielded only about 315K fry; the group discussed the value of overloading Beach C and possibilities for promoting uniform dispersion of spawning fish. The group also discussed counter accuracy issues and data quality. We agreed that there is a range of error in the data, which confounds trend interpretation and can impair good decision making. The outstanding question is whether that range is knowable and consistent over time (i.e., can we at least pull trends from the data we have)? Kevin will look at the brood year data for 2003, 2004, & 2005 to check if the % error is consistent. Spawning Beach 3- Fry are not counted as they emigrate from the beach. These are brood from the 500 adult fish that were allowed to spawn in the facility. Consistent pathological advice is to spread the risk around which includes distributing adult fish in this facility, but low-water supply issues prevail at times which are then augmented by pumping water into the facility. Artificial incubation program- Sockeye fry production went well. A total of 1.18 million fry were produced. Of these, 75% (777,000) were released to Baker Lake and 25% (263,000) to Lake Shannon; and 147,000 held back for delayed releases from the rearing program. Sockeye Beach Loading Plan Beach 4: 850 will be loaded to all (sections A, B, D) except C, which will get 1,200 for one more year so we can get a third year of trend data. Beach 3: Given the official drought condition & minimal snow pack, Kevin shared his concern that we may not have enough water to pump Beach 3 during late summer. If there isn’t enough water to keep the pump going, we wouldn’t sacrifice those fish; if it becomes necessary, we would net them and transfer them to the lake. Given the resource costs to maintaining the beaches during low-water years, is it worthwhile to load Beach 3 with adults in 2005? After discussion, the group reached consensus to not load fish into Beach 3, and to maximize artificial incubation instead. Kevin & Gary decided to use 225 fish as the additional amount to increase the artificial incubation program (to equal the yield we could have expected from Beach 3). This would raise the artificial incubation program from 1,300 to 1,525 adults.

Co-Manager’s preliminary Baker sockeye return forecast is for 17,000. There is discussion among the Fish Co-Managers of a potential sockeye fishery at Baker Lake. This is in addition, to a potential fishery in the river near the mouth of the Baker River at Concrete. Fish Rearing Inventories & Releases Doug described the inventory of fish at the Upper Baker rearing facility; refer to the “Baker Project Fish Inventory” handout. Doug walked the group through the status of the fish at the facility where the fish have been released and the plans for fish contained at the ponds. He also reviewed the distribution of releases for the spring of this year.

There was discussion about early-returning ad-clip/coded-wire tagged Chinook; the committee decided that the co-managers need to make the decision about whether or not to sacrifice these fish as stated in the current protocol. Jon-Paul will facilitate the co-managers discussion and tell PSE their decision. PSE will let the ARG members know. Doug will change the protocol sheet accordingly. Except for the protocol for ad-clip/coded-wire tagged Chinook (which may change – see above), the trap protocol will continue to be followed as is. Daytime Downramping The project has occasionally been downramping during the daytime. Cary reported that this issue has Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Aquatic Resources Group, June 15, 2005 Page 5 been addressed (there was some confusion due to a recent change in management) and that communication will continue to be improved. RELICENSE STUDIES UPDATE A-38 Native Char Investigation Phil presented the one-page schematic (Figure 5-1) from the April 2005 Native Char Investigations Report and reviewed with us the discussions that took place at the May 2 technical teamlet meeting on this subject. The team decided to increase the frequency of snorkel surveys in Sulphur Creek, and to conduct night snorkeling at the peak of the run. Upper Baker River snorkel surveys: According to the study plan, Baker River segment has been divided into four sections. For 2005, they will snorkel reaches 2 and 3. In the future, they will consider expanding sampling into tributaries by partnering with other groups (in 2006 and beyond). R2 will be electro-fishing two groundwater tributaries in southwest Lake Shannon to survey for juvenile native char, they will try to use dip nets to capture juvenile native char in Sulphur Creek at night. Temperature: We will continue to monitor temperatures at select tributaries to get two years of data at a site before removing the recorders. Angling: Doug reported that there were 14 char captures at the Upper Baker downstream fish passage facility and one previously floy-tagged fish. At Lower Baker, there were four captures and one previously tagged; six char were captured in the adult trap. We will continue sampling, dividing angling effort this year between Baker Lake and Lake Shannon. A-09 Instream Flows Phil talked the group through the progress to date on the Instream Flow report. The draft report may be out in August before the next ARG meeting. EARLY IMPLEMENTATION Fish Passage: Nick reviewed with us the schedule for the Floating Surface Collector (FSC), Net Transition Structure (NTS), moorage system, and launch site (graving dock). 30% drawings are done for FSC & NTS. They plan to begin construction of the launch site in mid-October and be operational by November 15. Fish Propagation Facilities Arnie reported that there have been a couple site visits by the engineering design contractor, HDR/FishPro at Spawning Beach 4 where the new hatchery will be built. The main thrust now will be to get the production program defined and production analysis, which will get us started designing. PSE will be contacting a teamlet or hatchery sub-group of the ARG to get input on a list of rearing and holding criteria we would propose to use for the hatchery. The goal is to get to 15% design of the hatchery by the end of the year. We have begun investigating permitting requirements. Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Aquatic Resources Group, June 15, 2005 Page 6 For the Aquatics articles, we’ve identified the contractors and consultants who will be working with us. Montgomery-Watson-Harza will continue to support the design development for the Downstream Fish Passage facilities; R2 for upstream passage, including passage connectivity; Washington Group for powerhouse upgrade design; and HDR/FishPro for the hatchery. For the development of the various management plans (including: Flow Implementation, Gravel Management, Large Woody Debris and Reservoir Shoreline Erosion) we will be working with R2. We will begin developing these management plans in early 2006. Shauna Tran is the new project manager at PSE for implementing the Baker License. BRICC Report Folks who were in attendance at the June 7 BRICC meeting updated the group. Highlight: Connie will be sending an invitation to all Settlement parties to participate in an information sharing session re: permitting with DOE, Concrete, Skagit and Whatcom Counties. This is to help new-comers to the process get their questions answered and issues/concerns addressed and support efficient progress on Settlement projects. ARG GROUP NORMS The group reviewed and discussed the norms. Suggestion: add a norm addressing handouts (sufficient quantity and clearly titled).
