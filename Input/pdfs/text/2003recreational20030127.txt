REPORT ON OLD ACTION ITEMS <b7> ALL: Reviewed Aesthetics Study plans and is ready with comments by the Jan 23 meeting. <b7> Andy: Sent out updated ownership maps before next meeting. This is still in process of being revised. <b7> Ann: Got Chris a map layer of USFS landslide analysis (historic and unstable soils layer on SRI). Joetta and Paula are working on it. <b7> Andy: Check with Cheryl re: DNR road access. <b7> Chris: Got together with Glacier to discuss access/objectives to include on roads layer of GIS map. <b7> Chris/Tony: Continued to evaluate land-use information (February timeframe). We have already collected everything that we need to satisfy FERC requirements. STUDIES Chris distributed a studies update & reviewed the status of each. R9: ELECTRON MONITORING The group discussed types of seasonal patterns of use, vehicle type and number of visitor use. Report to be completed by 2/03. R12: SITE INVENTORY Baker River Project Relicense January 27, 2003 Page 2 of 5 FERC Project NO. 2150 Recreation Resources Working Group   Chris asked for feedback on expectations regarding report since this is currently a database. Ann said she was looking for "red flags" for cross resource implications. Group members requested a summary of the database, how the study took place, and observations of characteristics & patterns of use regarding clusters of sites. The observations should be linked together with the site inventory. R13: VISITOR SURVEY Chris said he has been analyzing information as batches of data have come in. Assuming he receives the last batch this week there will be an interim report by mid-February. Regarding section 3, Chris will include analysis in Needs Analysis. (R16). R14: SECONDARY DATA Chris noted this is data that gets fed into other reports, especially the Needs Analysis. Documentation for R14 will be a list of data checked & references reviewed. R11/15: CAPACITY/SUITABILITY ANALYSIS (INCLUDING TRAILS) Chris reported there have been 2 teamlet meetings. Chris summarized teamlet decisions regarding map layers. R2 is working on assembling layers of GIS map. R2 will have a draft by 2/3/03. Chris noted that we should schedule a teamlet meeting. We may be able to review the results on 2/4/03. R16: NEEDS ANALYSIS Chris reported that there is a internal working draft of the first 6 pieces of the Needs Analysis. We need to fold in, eventually, the results of the Visioning Exercise. Chris plans to have 1-6 Analysis complete mid to late February. The group agreed that Adoptive Management would be important to thinking of future needs. VISIONING EXERCISE: Andy & Ann have created an outline and are compiling data from this exercise. Ann is working on mapping. Visioning report should be in draft form by March 2003. R5: VISUALS AND AESTHETICS STUDY The group reviewed Project R-5 study plan. The group agreed to give Andy input regarding sufficiency of pictures. Pending this review, the group approved the study plan. The schedule will slip by 5-6 weeks because original schedule has called for approval in December 2002. Study will have stand alone report from which excerpts will be extracted for PDEA. If parts are available for April draft, they will be included in PDEA. We will look for ways to compress schedule without comprising the study. PME DISCUSSION Teamlet Report: Regarding January 15th teamlet meeting, Andy reported that the group further developed the following 4 PME's: - Dispersed recreation - Developed recreation - Trails - Education The group also developed editing protocols. Andy asked whether he could soon accept the changes (to avoid PME's looking too messy.) No group member objected to this, so long as substantive stakeholder differences are still included in the text. Bruce & Cary reviewed the FERC "on the record" rules. The draft PME's will not be part of FERC record, per Steve Hocking. Nevertheless, we need to keep track of concerns to avoid the need for future appeals. The teamlet will meet on 2/3/03, and cover remaining PME's, matrix and mapping information.
