REPORT ON OLD ACTION ITEMS <b7> Tony: Checked to see if 401Water Quality certification is current. PSE is currently operating under IPP (i.e., there currently is no 401 certification for the project). Preparation for Water Quality certification is underway (to be officially initiated with submittal of the license application).  PROCESS FOR IDENTIFYING DRAFT PM&E MEASURES Baker River Project Relicense July 22, 2002 FERC Project NO. 2150 Recreation Resources Working Group  Page 2 of 6   Dee Endelman, of Agreement Dynamics, presented the Solution Team's request that she start working with the Working Groups (approximately 1 <bd> hours each meeting) to begin coming up with a very sketchy draft of potential PM&Es. She distributed a draft outline of the process along with an initial framing of the issues this group originally defined (in October 2000). Prior to this meeting, Chris reviewed the issues and came up with a list of five key issues (framed as problems to be solved).  All were asked to review this list to see that the interests of their organizations are represented. The following additional issues or concepts were mentioned as important to be included in the list: <b7> Nature study/observation <b7> Dispersed camping <b7> Consumptive uses (hunting/gathering/fishing/wood cutting, etc.) <b7> Make sure the bullets listed under #1 respect balance with fish and wildlife <b7> List ADA compliance separate from general public accessibility <b7> Changing recreation needs <b7> Balance of recreation between Baker and Shannon The Recreation Settlement Teamlet will meet via conference call on Tuesday, August 13, from 9:00 - 11:00. Teamlet members are Jim, Lauri, Chris, and Ann (with Ardis as backup). Dee will facilitate.  R16: VISIONING EXERCISE TEAMLET Chris distributed notes from the teamlet conference call of May 24. They discussed the scope of participation that would be appropriate. Should it be limited mainly to current working group members? Should we include certain specialists e.g., Recreation Resource Management, Whatcom County, Skagit County, North Cascades Institute, Audubon Society (Christy Norman), Pacific Northwest Trails Association, Town of Concrete, Washington Outfitters and Guides Association? (The May 24 discussion resulted in the conclusion that participation in the visioning exercise should be limited, primarily to members of the recreation working group. This conclusion was revisited in the July 22 discussion.)  Re: Format, Ann suggested that a USFS facilitator attend our August 22 meeting to explain the USFS "Recreation Focus" approach and provide a "train-the-trainer" session for us. Ann briefly described the "Recreation Focus" process. It involves breaking down the geographical areas into patterns of social use and identifying "special places" within these areas, identifying attributes that make those places special, and then brainstorming the future (addressing issues and how to handle conflicts).  We discussed doing a first iteration with the Forest Service facilitator and then going through the process with the counties, City of Concrete, DNR, Crown Pacific, and the new Trillium property owner(s). We could then assess next steps based on the results of that exercise.  Jim distributed a handout on estimates of future participation in outdoor recreation activities that he was preparing as an Interagency Committee for Outdoor Recreation report to support the Statewide Comprehensive Outdoor recreation Plan (SCORP). He suggested these trends should be taken into account in the Visioning Exercise.  Baker River Project Relicense July 22, 2002 FERC Project NO. 2150 Recreation Resources Working Group  Page 3 of 6   We agreed to invite the Forest Service facilitator (Kathy Ludlow) to our August 22 meeting to explain the Forest Service process and work with us to develop an appropriate format for us to do the Visioning Exercise. As described in the Study Plan, the aim of this exercise is to identify improvements and management actions that may be needed but were not identified through any of the six preceding needs analysis tasks. This relates to the ninth stated objective for study R16, which is "What types of recreational activities are emerging uses or uses that might occur in the future, and are not currently supported by existing recreation facilities and management programs?" We agreed to consider using the regular September 23 meeting for the Visioning Exercise. We'll determine appropriate next steps after meeting with the Forest Service facilitator at our August meeting. REVIEW OF 2001 DATA/2002 DATA NEEDS: R13 SURVEY DATA Chris distributed hard copies of R13 survey results received last week, and walked through the results for each question included in this package by presenting the spreadsheets on the projector. (These results are from second-stage processing of survey responses, focusing on various groups or subsets of the total population. Initial response tabulations for the total population were distributed in February 2002.) We discussed the data. The compilation of the second-stage results is nearly complete (results for the remaining questions should be available by end of July). Next Steps: Chris will email spreadsheets with complete results from the second-stage analysis for R13 as soon as they become available. R15: SECONDARY DATA COLLECTION This is ongoing. A few information sources have yet to be collected. Stay tuned. R9: ELECTRONIC MONITORING This is ongoing. (Counters were reinstalled in late April.) R11: CAPACITY AND SUITABILITY This is ongoing. (The primary component of this study is GIS analysis, which the Forest Service is preparing for the national forest lands and PSE will do for the Lower Baker area. Most of this work will follow the results of the needs analysis.) R15: RECREATIONAL TRAIL ROUTING This is ongoing (using same process as using for R11). R16: RECREATION NEEDS ANALYSIS This is ongoing. (The first six tasks, i.e., all tasks prior to the visioning exercise, have been started and are in various stages of completion.)

PSE is still working with the folks who put the model together to bolster the outputs. He distributed handouts that describe the model and what the outputs would entail. He also handed out a draft request form we would use to run various scenarios.  RESULTS OF WORKING GROUP REVIEW, AREAS TO ADDRESS Chris distributed summarized data from the Working Group review conducted at the May meeting. Areas to address are pre-judging of people and ideas, sense of teamwork, behaviors matching words, giving more positive than negative feedback and willingness to compromise sometimes.  For specific roles, the Team Leader needs to represent PSE's interests in a more collaborative way and getting help to complete tasks in a more timely manner. (Welcome Alex!) The facilitator will work on enforcing group norms and remaining neutral regarding participant's interests. Consultants need more help in getting work done in a timely manner.
