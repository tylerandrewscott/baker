PME MATRIX UPDATE Dee distributed an updated version of the Terrestrial matrix for potential PMEs. All are encouraged to review the list and let Dee know by the end of the work-day Monday (Oct. 28) if they have any concerns.  She walked us through a summary she had written up to share with the Solution Team. We edited the summary.  Bruce shared with us a high-level view of the schedule relating to PMEs. He discussed putting first draft of PMEs together starting in November. There will be workshops in February 2003 to discuss how to resolve issues across resource areas to put together the second draft (management plans). Second draft PME's would be put together in March 2003, if possible. The PDEA process is starting now (PSE had hired Louis-Berger to perform this function and Kathy Smayda (developing the terrestrial sections) will be attending key meetings). FERC will probably request Preliminary Terms, Conditions, and Recommendations in October 2003, and the Final Terms, Conditions, and Recommendations due in June 2004. Sections and articles for the Settlement Agreement will be turned in with the License application by April 2004.  Marty will send out a first cut at PMEs using the format suggested by Bruce by October 31. This will give us a week to review it before meeting November 8 at Lacey to work on these.  Study # T2 T4 T5  Title Vegetation Mapping in Project Area Analysis Species Assessment Wetland Inventory Study  Notes/Next Steps Erin Colclazier (Hamer Associates) provided an update on upland map corrections, drawdown zone plant classifications, and completion date. All species reviews will be completed by November (4 weeks). These will be treated a dynamic documents. The reviews will be completed by 21 November (4 weeks). To date, reviews of 17 species have been drafted. Nine species have been completed and sent out to the committee, 4 species are currently being edited and 4 species are in the process of being reviewed. This leaves us with 16 species to complete. All this information will be archived in a public document room at PSE. We agreed to add two new species: Beller's Ground Beetle and Hatch's Click Beetle. WDFW has PHS management recommendations for each of these species. Tom Hamer will review these. The results of this study will be integrated into the T2  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 10/24/2002 MEETING NOTES Lyn Wiltse for Terrestrial Technical Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 3 of 5   T6 T7 T7b T-9,10 T11 R-T12 T13 T15 T16 T17  Noxious Weed Assessment and Control Plan Historic Vegetation of the UB and LB Projects Future vegetation mapping Recreation use, effects on Mt.

The nearly Final Study Plan has been completed and sent to committee. Final comments from Laurel and Ann will be incorporated and a Final Study Plan report, which should be final by our November 21 meeting. A Draft Final Report was distributed. All were asked to get comments to Marty by November 7. Marty pointed out that the definition of "riparian" is within 50 feet of stream edge for T7 and within 100 feet for T15. He also explained that the flood plain for Baker was derived from 1952 USGS topo map along with maps done in 1956 and 1959. Marty got assumptions on road densities from R2. He is assuming that PSE would sell its land to Crown Pacific <ad> so it would stay vegetated as industrial forest land. He is also incorporating assumptions on seral stage growth. Marty will put together some future scenarios along with these assumptions for our review at our November 21 meeting. We have high country use information from the visitor surveys conducted by the Recreation Working Group during the summer of 2001. It includes an estimate of the Baker Lake overnight users that also visit the high country. We will discuss the next steps (mountain goat-related PME?) at our next meeting. Final report completed and sent out for review. It doesn't appear that there are any in the basin. The report should be final by our November 21st meeting. On hold depending on T15 and working group needs. Don emailed a write-up outlining the study need for our review by October 24th and we were to discuss at our October meeting. This has been deferred for discussion at the November 21st meeting. Final report completed and sent out for review. The report should be final by our November 21 meeting. Tony showed us the current versions of the Seral Stage and Major Vegetation Cover type maps. We discussed how to make the legends more specific (clear definitions for both maps) for the Seral Stage maps. We will replace "riparian" with the appropriate cover type. We will re- look at riparian in the future to make sure it makes sense. Draft Final report completed and sent out for review. The Draft Final report is complete except distributional information. Joetta Zablotney plans to have the amphibian species distribution maps completed by this Friday (25 October) and the report is estimated to be complete by the week of the 28th of October and sent to the committee.  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 10/24/2002 MEETING NOTES Lyn Wiltse for Terrestrial Technical Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 4 of 5   R-T18 Breeding Bird Surveys R-T19 Habitat Evaluation Studies  On hold. The HEP teamlet met September 24 and via conference call October 18. They agreed the group could use HEP as a monitoring tool to evaluate PME success. We also agreed that we need a methodology to analyze/interpret data from studies in order to come up with PMEs for a Settlement Agreement. We might look at using modified HSI parameters to see what would be needed. STEPS defined at the conference call: 1. Finish the T7b study 2. Use the analysis species literature reviews to determine what habitats are important to the analysis species. 3. Compare the results of T7b to the analysis species literature reviews to select/prioritize species for a habitat assessment 4. Develop any additional information on the habitat requirements of the analysis species needed to conduct a habitat assessment. 5. Conduct a habitat assessment. 6. Use the results of the habitat assessment to guide PME development.. Concern was expressed about trading off precision (ground truthing, possibly species by species) for the sake of meeting a schedule for PMEs. The teamlet will meet again in early December to flesh out the assessment approach. This will occur after we get the data from T4 and T7b (November 21).  RT20 RT21 T22  Wildlife Use in the Reservoir Drawdown Zone Elk studies Fluctuation Zone Enhancement  A Draft Plan will be ready for review October 25. All have until October 28 to submit comments on the Elk Study Plan to Tony. There was discussion around the intent of the study, the scope and how we would use the results. Could we use this to start to put together a management plan for the life of the license? The existing amount of the elk forage in the Project area is available through T2. We also have supplemental information in T7b and T15. We may limit the elk study to the Baker Basin to speed up the GIS work. The elk teamlet will meet again (via conference call November 13th) to work through these issues so we can get Ron Tressler (EDAW) on board and with clear direction. Tony will coordinate the initial drafting of this report. We will look at having the literature review complete by yearend.
