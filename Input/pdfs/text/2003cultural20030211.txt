REPORT ON OLD ACTION ITEMS <b7> Kelly and Chris: Talked to Scott re date for Archaeology/TCP presentation to Upper Skagit Tribe. <b7> Jessie: Talked further to USFS and Frank W. re CRMP approach. Jessie shared with Frank our intent to develop a more encompassing CRMP with section for HPMP. He (representing FERC) wants us to call it the Historical Places Management Plan instead. We agreed to do this, noting that in this plan we will include both National Register and non-National Register things. <b7> Jessie: Added items to the outline and reported she did not prepare a general paper re cultural interests for next meeting since the focus of the Workshop has changed. <b7> Chris and Kelly: Started working on putting outline ideas in "active" voice; will button up with Bruce.  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 2-11-03 MEETING Cultural and Historic Resources Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 2   <b7> Kelly: Checked in with Jason and Larry re UDP status. <b7> Jessie: Talked with Frank re: sending out SHPO letter. She also sent it to Allen Stanfill at the Advisory Council, to USFS, NPS, and DNR.  PDEA STATUS RE: CULTURAL RESOURCES Connie and Jessie met with Pat Weslowski of the Louis-Berger Group re: information requirements by March 31 and passed information on to Chris and Kelly. The first draft will be out May 1 for review by participants in the ALP. Most information gaps should be resolved by June 1, for the September 30 draft. That draft will be sent out for public review for a 90-day comment period.  TRADITIONAL CULTURAL PROPERTIES Kelly reported that she is continuing to meet with the tribes to come up with a research design that meets their interests as well as the requirements of FERC. Discussions are ongoing. We should have a completed research design by our April meeting. Scott and Larry expressed appreciation for help with this. In the meantime, Kelly's continuing her research on ethnographic archives.  We want to ensure that our settlement agreement will include a mechanism to allow for ongoing consultation which may require ongoing TCP research over the term of the license.  HISTORIC PROPERTIES MANAGEMENT PLAN (formerly known as CRMP) Chris reported that she has been doing research on contents of management plans from Chelan, FERC, Army Corps of Engineers and others. She distributed two outlines that she liked: Oroville and Chelan PUD.

PLAN FOR MARCH CROSS-RESOURCE WORKSHOP BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 2-11-03 MEETING Cultural and Historic Resources Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 3   Prior to the Workshop A CD listing all the PMEs that each research Working Group is considering along with a draft agenda for the March Workshop will be out by February 18th. Participants will be asked to fill out a pre-workshop worksheet to consider how to resolve conflicts, etc. PSE plans to send out their proposal (with elements of Working Group PMEs) for review on Feb. 26 March 4, Tuesday (afternoon only) 1:00-5:00 High level PMEs presentations by a member of each Working Group (Cultural, Terrestrial, Aquatics, Recreation, Economics/Operations). Bob has graciously accepted our request that he do our presentation. Probable Attendees: Connie. Larry, Jessie, Bob, Kelly, Chris March 5, Wednesday (all day) Dee will begin with a review of the background of our process to date. She will then do a brief training session on interest-based negotiations to kick things off. Then we will walk through PSE's Proposal, highlighting pieces that have cross-resource implications e.g., The proposed reservoir management regime. Joel Molander of PSE will explain how PSE came up with its reservoir management plan (share outputs from HYDROPs model runs, etc.) Then we will split up into distinct resource areas to: <b7> Flag impacts on resource (add conflicts to lists already posted from Feb. Working Group meeting) <b7> List how it affects the organizational interests <b7> Report back to the larger group Probable Attendees: Connie, Jessie, Scott, Larry, Kelly March 6, Thursday (all day) <b7> Finish PSE Proposal (pieces with cross resource implications) <b7> Review (amended) list of conflicts <b7> Brainstorm to resolve conflicts <b7> Review (amended) list of conflicts <b7> Brainstorm to optimize synergies <b7> Plan next steps Probable Attendees: Connie, Jessie, Scott, Kelly UDP STATUS Kelly has been reviewing this plan with the Tribes. They are making some edits and feel like they are "pretty close". APE /SHPO LETTER Jessie reported that she received a letter of concurrence on our APE from SHPO along with the acknowledgement that there may be a need to amend the APE over time as new information is uncovered. We also discussed that as the project is implemented, there may be other changes that are needed over time.  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 2-11-03 MEETING Cultural and Historic Resources Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 4   Jan expressed concern that some areas of the APE appear to be "undesignated" with regard to potential (this is an artifact from HRA's classification). When the GIS map is updated it will include areas surveyed and an explanation of why other areas were not surveyed. Any areas we don't cover that we feel should be surveyed will be included in our management plan. EROSION CONTROL STUDY Jessie sent out the draft erosion study done by AESI for the Aquatics Working Group. Charlie (with NWAA) is doing some geomorphology follow-up to this study. All were asked to get Jessie feedback by the end of February. ARCHAEOLOGY & TRADITIONAL CULTURAL PROPERTIES PRESENTATION Kelly is in discussion with the Tribes on doing presentations for them at each of their Tribal Headquarters. They are looking at doing these this spring. We'll get an update/report at our April meeting. We are very excited about this opportunity to share information.
