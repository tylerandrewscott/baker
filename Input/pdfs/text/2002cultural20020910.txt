REPORT ON OLD ACTION ITEMS • Jessie: Sent Frank the Research Design and the latest version of the UDP. • Jessie: Checked with Grant County PUD re: their UDP and Interim Plan. • Jessie:: Checked with Chelan County re: interim plan. • Jessie: Worked on completing draft APE to include the FERC boundary. SOLUTION TEAM UPDATE Lyn shared that the Solution Team has asked all of the resource area Working Groups to submit a preliminary list of potential PMEs by the end of October. This is to help accomplish the over-arching aim of turning in a Settlement Agreement along with the license application by the end of April, 2004. The Solution Team has moved their October meeting date to October 30 to allow maximum time for the Working Groups to accomplish this task. Dee Endelman of Agreement Dynamics has been assisting the working groups to help them accomplish this task. She has been doing this by spending approximately 90 minutes at the start of each working group meeting. She has also been meeting with some technical working groups off line to assist them in developing their lists. The first step was to review the original list of issues that all the groups drafted over a year ago. The next step has been to rephrase the issues as problems to be solved. Once the groups agree on the list of issues, they begin brainstorming possible protection/mitigation/enhancement (PME) measures. No effort will be made to distinguish among the PM or E. The Solution Team understands that this Working Group has distinct needs and won’t be able necessarily to follow the same process that the other groups are following. We agreed to have Dee come visit us at the start of our meeting in October to discuss with us how we should proceed in terms of developing PMEs. Bruce Freet, formerly of the NPS will be subcontracting to Dee (Agreement Dynamics) to assist with development of the Settlement Agreement. Both will attend our meetings in October and November.  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 09/10/02 MEETING Cultural and Historic Resources Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 2   NEW CONTRACTOR Northwest Archaeology (Christian Miss) has been hired to complete the archaeological inventory. Equinox Consulting (Kelly Bush) will be coordinating the TCP work. Chris will be attending our meeting in October. Chris and Kelly have an ongoing relationship/history of working together. This linkage will help us address Indian Cultural Resources. Larry reported that he has worked with Kelly also, and that he and she were often on the same page. INTERIM PLANS Currently, crews up at the Project may not be clear about when they need to consider cultural resources before performing what they consider to be routine task. Jessie reported that managers at PSE will be putting together a list of activities that might/might not require archaeological review before being performed. The list of these activities (e.g., ditch cleaning, road grading, culvert filling, etc.) would be reviewed by this Working Group before passing it on to the crews. We are also discussing creating an MOU with the Forest Service about when to notify and/or seek counsel from the Forest Service. Q&A WITH DR. FRANK WINCHELL, FERC We were pleasantly surprised to have Frank attend the meeting in person for a second month in a row! We really appreciate the support. Question: “What type of policies are Frank seeing from the Bush Administration (e.g., streamlining the licensing process, etc.)?” Frank explained that while Section 106 has remained relatively unchanged with the new administration, the new emphasis is on meeting relicensing deadlines. Frank also announced that he is moving away from programmatic agreements and back to focusing on management plans. The PA is merely a tool used to implement the management plans. The PA now has standardized language from FERC. This will also streamline the relicensing process. APE UPDATE After reviewing past notes re: the APE boundary, Jessie reported that there are still a few areas that we need to discuss. • We agreed that our APE should always at least include the FERC boundary. • We have agreed to include recreation dispersed camp sites with in ¼ mile of the high water line. • We agreed to also include some recreation dispersed recreation camp sites outside a ¼ mile of the high water line by exception. • We are still considering: creek mouths, trails and roads, and articulation with uplands. Consider a "pipeline " survey that includes Baker Lake trail? We hope to resolve these remaining issues at our October meeting.
