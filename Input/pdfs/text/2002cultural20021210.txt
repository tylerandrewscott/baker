Evaluate Meeting INTRODUCTIONS We welcomed Ken Juell from Northwest Archaeological Associates (NWAA), who has been supervising field crews for the archaeological work. He walked us through a prehistoric site for our field trip. NEW ACTION ITEMS • Chris: Follow up re: status of archaeology survey previously done on Baker Lake Trail. • Jessie: Send out revised version of HRA’s Historical Resources Study Request. • Jessie: Schedule HYDROPS model demonstration at a future meeting- February or March? • Jessie: Send out initial draft of APE map and rationale (include disclaimer re: changeability). • All: Review UDP high-level flow chart job aid and give Jessie Feedback at January meeting. • Jessie: Send out final APE map and rationale to participants so we can discuss and possibly give a final nod at our January 14 meeting. • Chris: Talk with Kelly re: doing a TCP presentation a tribal representative. • Jessie: Make changes we discussed today and send out UDP for formal review (letterhead, etc). • Jessie: Email reminder to Frank re: PA. • Frank: Sent Jessie sample Programmatic Agreements (PAs) to share with this group. REPORT FROM FIELD TRIP The field trip was in the reservoir drawdown, where there was a prehistoric lithic scatter. During the site tour, we observed both erosional and depositional effects to the site; we had an opportunity to examine a variety of lithic raw material types and chipped stone artifact categories; and we were shown an undisturbed portion of the site above the high pool, including an intact soil sequence. NWAA has also found four historic sites and two isolates. They are also surveying above the drawdown in the trees. They have several more weeks to go. They will conclude the drawdown survey next February or March, as they are hoping for a low reservoir level at that time. Fourteen of the seventeen localities recorded by HRA are currently under water. Chris Miss’ folks are re-visiting those sites to determine if further investigation is required as they become exposed. REPORT ON OLD ACTION ITEMS • ALL: By November 20, gave Jessie feedback on HRA’s Historical Resources Study Request. She incorporated the feedback she received and passed it on to HRA to include in a revised version of the study plan which should be out prior to out next meeting. • Jessie: Checked with Joel Molander re: doing HYDROPS model demonstration for the Upper Skagit Tribe by end of the year. Kris Olin (PSE) is following up. DEBRIEF FROM PME SESSION (DECEMBER 9) We agreed that it was a good session. Dee will be updating the list of culturally/historically relevant issues and sending them out for our review prior to the next meeting. At that meeting (Jan. 14), Bruce and Dee will share with us the potential PMEs that are being considered by other resource working BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 12-10-02 MEETING Cultural and Historic Resources Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 2   groups. We will review these lists to see if there are potential conflicts or synergistic opportunities to explore at our March cross-resource workshop. QUESTIONS & Answer /FERC – FERC Relicensing Timeline Frank clarified our question from the PME meeting re: NAGPRA. NAGPRA procedures apply to federal lands and any artifacts being stored/curated in a federal facility. State regulations R.C.W. 27.53 (artifacts) and R.C.W. 27.44 (human remains) apply to private lands. Frank also reviewed the relicensing schedule with us. The license application is due April 30, 2004. The official draft license application and draft PDEA would go out for review September 30, 2003. The schedule shows us submitting a draft Historic Properties Management Plan (formerly referred to as CRMP) also by then. Frank stressed the importance of sticking to this schedule. He said it would be helpful if we had a first draft plan to review by May of 2003. EROSION STUDY RESULTS These results are expected by the end of this year. Jessie will keep us posted. UDP STATUS Jessie hasn’t heard anything from the Tribes on this. She asked how we might most appropriately refer to former working group members such as the Concrete Heritage Museum. We agreed to amend the language on the UDP to include only current working group participants. Further, we agreed to update the contact list by listing NW Archaeological Associates and Equinox. A memo went out to Baker Project personnel and relicense contractors re: this plan. Once it is officially approved, training for PSE crew members will follow. Jessie distributed a high-level flow chart for what to do/who to call in the event of an unanticipated discovery. INFORMATION SHARING It may be a good time to share information with the Tribes about the current status of the cultural work. We might do this in February of 2003, preferably at a tribal location(s). HANDOUTS • FERC Guidelines for the Development of Historic Properties Management Plans for FERC Hydroelectric Projects • Nov. 26 2002 Version of the Relicensing Schedule • High level flow chart to accompany UDP PARKING LOT • “How do we address upland areas?” (importance of mountain goats) • Develop “Area of Potential Effects” Map • Coordinate with Terrestrial and Recreation Working Groups • Glossary of terms: what are “protection,” “mitigation,” and “enhancement”? • Develop TCP (Traditional Cultural Properties) studies • Rotate meeting locations to tribal facilities?
