Seattle, WA 98188  MEETING NOTES Mission Statement: To develop an efficient fish passage design for the Baker River Project. Attendees: Ken Bates (WDFW), Gary Sprague (WDFW), Steve Fransen (NMFS), Stan Walsh (SSC), Arnie Aspelund (PSE), Nick Verretto (PSE), Kevin Brink (PSE), Cary Feldmann (PSE), Wayne Porter (PSE), Lyn Wiltse (facilitator) Note: Future meeting dates are: Sept. 28, October 19, November 16, 2000 from 9:00 to 3:00 at the SeaTac Airport West Coast Hotel.  New Action Items <b7> Nick, Ken, Wayne, Cary, and possibly Mort will hold a conference call either Sept. 12th or 25th to develop further options/combinations of brainstormed passage concepts <b7> Everyone: Review list of potential action items and consider possible combinations, with following considerations/weighting factors: - Pros and cons - Availability of technology - Meets interests (good for fish, operation, for all life history stages, for other interests, economically viable) - Could it meet present criteria standards? (For information only) "Old" Action Items: <b7> Fred will bring Skagit Chinook length-frequency data  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 1   <b7> Fred will look at statistical variation from year to year in the gulper mark and recovery data (by September) <b7> A lengthy discussion of the need for collection of additional temperature data was prompted by Nick Verretto, who has not yet initiated vertical column data collection (using the Hydrolab) at the Lower Baker gulper. It was decided that temperature data would be collected once per week at both Upper and Lower Baker. Upper Baker data would consist of depth vs. temperature from the surface to 160' in 10' increments using the Hydrolab. Two data loggers will be deployed at 190' and 225' (depth from the surface). Lower Baker data would be collected in the same way to 100' depth using a portable temperature meter. Additional data loggers will be installed at depths of 150' and 200 feet <b7> Kevin Brink will analyze how fluctuation limits affect spill (# events, amounts, seasons, duration, flow-days by month), to facilitate discussions regarding limits to drawdown range and effects on screening designs. Kevin will report at the October 19th meeting <b7> Fred will look at statistical variation year-to-year in the gulper mark and recovery data (by September) <b7> Nick will bring rough analysis of gulper pump cycle test <b7> All members bring interests of your organizations <b7> All review the affinitized lists of data to be collected  Report on Completed Action Items: <b7> Nick distributed disks with: <b7> Upper Baker spill frequency data <b7> Lower Baker spill frequency data <b7> Data from gulper pump cycle test <b7> Length frequency-data <b7> Gary distributed information on reservoir productivity models. He reported that Dr. Mike Brett, Univ. of WA. (Center of Streamside Studies) is a possible contact. 206-616-3447 or 206-543-2549, mtbrett@u.washington.edu.  Brainstorm: What does successful downstream fish passage look like?  1. Works Well for Fish <b7> Every migrating fish successfully emigrates from the sub-basin minimal or no migration delay <b7> Minimal intervention <b7> Performance criteria goal is for at least 95% successful, with mitigation for less than 100% passage <b7> High % of fish emigrating from the basin <b7> Survival (fish health) would be better than wild migrants over the same distance <b7> Does not create an unnatural predation opportunity (concentrating fish in a way not found in nature, alternate release locations, minimal disorientation) <b7> Does not increase smolt mortality (over natural conditions) <b7> Accommodates all migratory species <b7> Needs to accommodate variable run sizes and timing <b7> Acceptable (functional) attraction/bypass flows <b7> Determine what target age classes we're after (all?) <b7> Minimize stress by handling and temperature <b7> At least maintains current numbers  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 2   <b7> Doesn't affect their ability to return to spawning grounds <b7> Emigrates from sub-basin in good condition <b7> Healthy migrating fish populations that are not listed under ESA 2. Needs to be Economic (Cost-effective) <b7> Needs to be durable for the length of the license <b7> Can be installed quickly (less than 10 years) 3. Works Well for the Operation <b7> Safe from human operator and fish friendly perspective (low rates of injury/mortality) <b7> Efficient from human/fish perspective (transferring of fish) <b7> Reliable, foolproof methods of fish collection and transport <b7> Hydraulically efficient (minimum head loss, balance) <b7> Geographically accessible <b7> Readily modifiable <b7> Accommodates all migratory species <b7> Has to accommodate flood flows <b7> Needs facility and run size monitoring (real time, ongoing basis) <b7> Needs to adhere to the KISS principle (keep it simple, stupid) <b7> Should provide for evaluation <b7> Determine what target age classes we're after (all?) <b7> Accommodates reservoir operation, including drawdown and spill <b7> Needs to be durable for the length of the license <b7> Can be installed quickly (less than 10 years) <b7> Must be adaptable to changing technology <b7> Easily operated and maintained (accommodates trash, debris, ice, sediment) 4. Works Well for All Life History Stages <b7> Make sure we provide a homing path that considers entire life cycle (doesn't affect their ability to return to spawning grounds) <b7> Minimal residualization of anadromous fish <b7> Successful guidance of fish through the system 5. Works Well for Other Interests <b7> Should accommodate other interests (not at the expense of project existence, recreational opportunities, etc.) <b7> Supports water quality objectives (reservoir and river management) <b7> Provides for public education <b7> Has to accommodate flood flows <b7> Needs to function over a variety of operations <b7> Accommodates reservoir operation, including drawdown and spill  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 3   Brainstorm: List of Possible Downstream Options for Solution  1.
