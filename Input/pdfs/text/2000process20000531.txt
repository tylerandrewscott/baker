Prepare a plan for obtaining consensus letters from stakeholders on Alternative Licensing Procedures (draft example consensus letter for July meeting) 3. Outline FERC filing requesting permission to use ALP (outline of what is required) NORMS OF PROCESS WORKING GROUP Group reviewed list of standard meeting and social norms. Group agreed to use consensus for decisionmaking within group. DISCUSSION RELATING TO COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS Connie read FERC letter denying Grant PUD's request to use Alternative Licensing Procedures. Group discussed that consensus of most of the participants in the Baker Relicense Process will be necessary for ALP request to be approved. Kathy handed out a definition of consensus. [From FERC Order No. 596 (Docket No. RM95-16-000, issued Oct. 29, 1997); order adopting alternative licensing procedures; can be found on FERC's website, www.ferc.fed.us.] Connie handed out a list of elements found in most protocols. Bruce provided another example protocol from Chelan PUD. Connie drew a diagram showing how with the ALP (or collaborative process), FERC sets up a FERC Collaborative Staff, which is advisory to the process. This staff differs from the regular FERC staff, which gives input to the Commissioners as part of a FERC proceeding. The following is a list of points the group decided should be addressed in the Baker Communications Protocol: 1. Introduction: include regulations 2. Purpose and need statement 3. Identification or definition (not list) of participants 4. Definitions of terms (glossary)  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 2   5. Responsibilities of parties (licensee, participants and FERC) 6. Time frame for protocol defined 7. Media coverage and news releases (who does media deal with; responsibility for press releases; extent statements made by individual participants don't reflect collective position) 8.
