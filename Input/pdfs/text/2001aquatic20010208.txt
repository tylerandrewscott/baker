Evaluate meeting FUTURE DATES The team decided to continue to meet at the PSE Office in Everett on the second Thursday of each month, from 9:30 to 2:30 for 2001: Mar. 8, Apr. 12, May 10, June 14, July 12, Aug. 9, Sept., 13, Oct 11, etc. NEW ACTION ITEMS • ALL: Get study requests for 2001 field season to Arnie by February 18th. • Arnie: Send hard copy of map lists of gage sites and today’s handouts of the Fish Passage Technical Working Group to Don Schluter. • Karen: Have Gary email spread-sheet to Don Schluter. REPORT ON OLD ACTION ITEMS • Nick and Arnie developed an index/bibliography of existing studies. Arnie distributed a handout of the initial draft of the Baker Project Alphabetical Reference List. We will continue to add to this list as we go. • Nick: Checked with Bob Barnes re: What % does the Baker make up of Skagit River flow (regulated/unregulated/over all seasons). This information will be covered by the R2 Presentation on the Skagit River Reconnaissance Level Survey conducted in May of 2000. • Arnie emailed study requests to all team members by February 2nd. OLDER ACTION ITEMS Gary: Bring hard copies of sockeye presentation SKAGIT RIVER RECONNAISSANCE LEVEL SURVEY PRESENTATION Sue Madsen and Phil Hilgert of R2 Resource Consultants walked through a Power point presentation of the objectives, scope, and results of their field reconnaissance. During a planned Project shut down in May 2000, staff from PSE and R2 Resource Consultants conducted a three -day survey of Skagit River habitat features. Sue Madsen and Phil Hilgert of R2 presented the results of the reconnaissance level surveys describing the distribution and frequency of side channels, gravel bars, depressions and large woody debris. A copy of the presentation will be available on Puget’s Baker River relicensing website. They also distributed hard copies of the presentation. Doug distributed copies of proposed Gage Site Locations for the Skagit River. UPDATE ON PROCESS DOCUMENT Arnie distributed copies of the latest draft of the Process Document for the relicensing of the Baker River Project. The group didn’t spend any time on it because it is still very much a draft and won’t even be reviewed by the Solution Team until March or possible April. FISH PASSAGE TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP UPDATE The Fish Passage Technical Working Group met on January 30, 2001. They are currently focusing on downstream fish passage (migration, attraction, collection and transport). They are Baker River Project Relicense 2 of 5 Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: B-river_2-08-01_fishWG_notes.doc; Lyn Wiltse reviewing some conceptual design concepts. They feel like they don’t have enough information yet to make a recommendation to go ahead with a design. They are initiating studies to provide answers so they can make recommendations to this group. LOWER BAKER MAINTENANCE With current basin flow levels at less than half what they normally are, it is possible that the Baker Project operations will run out of water by the first week in March. The agencies decided that the best use of that water is to keep water levels in the Skagit River at 7600cfs (for fish) as long as possible and hope for rain. PSE will take the maintenance outage at Baker River beginning in April (or sooner if it runs out of water) and lasting 16 weeks. The goal is to refill Lower Baker in time to reach spill crest height in time for the summer sockeye returns, June 25th. HYDROLOGIC REVIEW PRESENTATION (R2 Resource Consultants) Sue and Phil walked the team through the hydrologic review they conducted. They also distributed hard copies of the presentation. Sue Madsen of R2 Resource Consultants presented an evaluation of the timing, magnitude, frequency and duration of down ramp events at Puget Sound Energy’s Baker River Project. The effect of Baker River Project, Skagit River Project and tributary inflow (e.g., Sauk River) on mainstream Skagit River stage fluctuations was examined using the 1996-1999 record of 15 minute stage intervals at six USGS gages. STUDY REQUEST SUBMITTALS The team reviewed the three new study requests that were distributed since our meeting last month. All team members were asked to submit study proposals to Arnie as soon as possible for the 2001 field season. Chuck reviewed the Upper Baker River Delta request that he submitted and the Corps is funding. He did a bull trout spawning habitat assessment at 700 feet. He will do the same at 708 and at 720. He may use a combination of old fashioned observation and aerial photos. There may be an opportunity for him to do a sockeye assessment at the same time. The study results are needed by USFW by August, 2001. Phil suggested Chuck look at (1) slope of the delta; (2) extend the survey to complete range of reservoir fluctuations; (3) available habitat at different pool levels 707, 708-720 (incremental approach); (4) effect of reservoir levels on habitat conditions?; (5) evaluate enhancement opportunities. Chuck will get together with PSE and others to determine how the scope of this study can be expanded to fulfill other data needs of the group. The group then reviewed the “Nutrient Addition to Baker and Shannon Lakes and Tributaries” submitted by the Wildcat Steelhead Club. Bill suggested we study the current levels of nutrients in the tributaries as well as the lakes to see if they are sufficient for optimal productivity. PSE said they are already facilitating nutrient supplementation with carcasses in the streams. Rod walked the group through the Department of Ecology’s proposed study: “Mainstem Skagit River Habitat Assessments and Flow/Habitat Relationships”. He said some of the concerns in this study were covered by R2’s presentation. STUDY REQUEST TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP: Baker River Project Relicense 3 of 5 Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: B-river_2-08-01_fishWG_notes.doc; Lyn Wiltse Stan, Nick, Arnie, Karen, Bill, Chuck, Rod, and Cary volunteered to form a technical working group to review study requests and make recommendations on which ones should be done in the 2001 field season. They will also be looking for opportunities to combine studies and or throw out studies in cases where they purport to collect data that are already available. They will be getting together on February 22 in one of the conference rooms at the PSE Office in Everett, starting at 9:00 a.m. to sift through all 2001 field season study requests and make recommendations to this group.
