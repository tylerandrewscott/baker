It looks like it will be spring before the road will be plow-able. Cary reported that on February 5th a mud slide occurred on the right bank of the Baker River downstream of Lower Baker Dam. REPORT FROM FISH PASSAGE TECHNICAL WORKING GROUPS The Upstream and Downstream Fish Passage Design Groups met February 4th and 5th. They continue conceptual design development and alternatives selection, and focused discussion on 2002 downstream behavioral studies at Upper Baker. Nick distributed handouts and schedules outlining these studies, which are separated into near-field (acoustic tag tracking of coho and sockeye for three-dimensional identification of fish movement) and far-field (radio tag tracking) releases. The studies will test movement during two treatments: low pool vs. high pool, and generation on vs. generation off. The timeline will be the seven weeks beginning April 29. Three additional studies include: radio-tagged kelts release at the upper end of the reservoir, PIT-tag & recovery of coho and sockeye in the near- and far-fields, as well as continuation of past releases of freeze-branded coho groups. ECONOMICS/OPERATIONS WORKING GROUP The Economics/Operations Working Group has been on hiatus for most of the last year, as they await the completion of the hydro operations model. Mark Killgore reported that they have been going through an in-depth review of the Charles Howard Hydro Operations model. It is compatible with Excel and fairly user friendly. They are planning to do a 1-2 hour overview to demonstrate the model and begin to answer questions (including algorithms used) at our April meeting. They will be doing this overview for each of the Working Groups in the various resource areas. They will follow up with a comprehensive all-day workshop in May or June where any interested working group participant would be encouraged to attend along with any technical folks from their organizations to assist in reviewing the adequacy of the model. SCOPING DOCUMENT 1 AND INITIAL CONSULTATION DOCUMENT We discussed Connie’s 2/12/02 memo explaining PSE’s decision (at FERC’s suggestion) to draft Scoping document 1 and issue it as a companion document to the Initial Consultation Document. All were reminded that the completion of Scoping Document 1 does not mean the end of the issue identification phase, and that PSE is sharing this initial draft in the spirit of collaboration. There will be a public meeting mid-May to discuss both documents and formal comments for the Scoping Document 1 will be due mid-June and for the ICD will be mid-July. COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL AND PROCESS DOCUMENT UPDATE Nothing new to report. The teamlet of agency and PSE attorneys continued their review and report that they are nearly complete with the Communication Protocol and Process Document. They are finishing up language around confidentiality and handling settlement. They hope to have these complete prior to the next Solution Team Meeting. It looks like PSE is going to Baker River Project Relicense Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 2-14-02_Final_fishWG_notes; Lyn Wiltse  3 of 8   request permission from FERC to use the Alternative Licensing Process at the end of the month. They will include these documents as part of their submission. STUDY REQUEST SUBMITTALS/STUDY PLAN DEVELOPMENT Study # Title Notes/Next Steps A01.A Reservoir Tributary Habitat Surveys Emily gave a PowerPoint presentation summary of the preliminary survey results. This presentation will be available on the website. The full report will be complete prior to our March 14 meeting. Results will be used to assess fish production potentials in the three basins and also to identify areas for P/M/E measures. A01.B Reservoir Tributary Biological Surveys Not discussed at this meeting. We will have a draft report this spring. A01.C Reservoir Tributary Delta Surveys Not discussed at this meeting. The delta portions of tributaries in the drawdown zone will be surveyed in the next few months. This will be a supplemental report. A02 LB River Habitat Mapping No changes since last meeting. A03 Reservoir Fish Population No changes since last meeting. Characteristics A04 LB/Skagit River Flow, Gaging No changes since last meeting. A05 Water Quality Sampling No changes since last meeting. A06 UB Passage Design Baffle Complete. Modification A07 Lower Baker Forebay Bathymetric Complete. Survey A08 UB Passage System Evaluation The study report from R-2 is complete. Arnie distributed a copy of the report generated through the Fish Passage Technical Working Group. A09A Skagit River Flow and Habitat The Interim Protection Plan is due February Assessment (HIGH PRIORITY) 15. The IPP concerns ESA issues for the remainder of the current license period. It may be useful as a reference going forward. After the IPP is complete we will reconsider our study plan and see if there are issues that have been resolved through the IPP and agree on next steps. The IPP addresses issues of flood control and supplementing low flows. A summary of this plan should be available for discussion at our March meeting. The IPP will be followed up shortly after with the Biological Baker River Project Relicense Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 2-14-02_Final_fishWG_notes; Lyn Wiltse  4 of 8   A09B Salmonid Redd Selection and Maintenance in the Middle Skagit in Response to River Fluctuation from Hydropower Peaking A09C Distribution, Timing and Depth of Salmonid Redds  A09D Distribution, Timing of Salmonid Fry A10  Baker River Delta Habitat AssessmentChar  A11 A12  Nutrient Addition Instream Flows for Bio-diversity  A13A Water Quality Impacts of Human Uses of the Reservoir and Adjacent Shorelines.

We agreed to move this to Study Plan (first priority is A9A). We’ll address it by this summer. We’ll submit the Study Plan for member review in June for discussion at July meeting. We are in the process of developing a Study Plan for this. Some preliminary work was already done last fall. These data will be incorporated into the plan. Submit Study Plan in June for discussion at July meeting. Stan suggested a snorkeling contingency if can’t get a permit.. Need Study Plan by March. Complete. Note: USFW is concerned with impacts to char and indirectly to bald eagles through chum and also to cutthroat. Not Discussed. Parking Lot. Not Discussed. Split between R-A21 & RA09. We discussed reservoir/road/toilet –induced recreation. Arnie will follow up with Recreation Working Group re: existing data and possible PMEs. Nick and Brady will discuss this offline with Greta. Nick and Arnie will discuss this offline. R2 has created an internal Study Plan Draft. They will send it out for team member review very soon and get in the field as soon as possible. Should have Study Plan in March. Not discussed at this meeting. Status as of October meeting: Data collection underway. Not discussed at this meeting. This is not time sensitive. We agreed to wait until the completion of A24 in March before developing a Study Plan. The US Corps of Engineers funded Little Baker Project to be a tie to this Study. Not discussed. Request pending; not for 2001. Not discussed at this meeting. Status as of October meeting: Merged into A-01.A habitat surveys conducted Aug & Sept 2001. Not discussed at this meeting.

Sue received comments on the Study Request from the Forest Service Consulting Team. She will respond and copy her responses to the group. The goal of this plan is to create a Large Woody Debris management plan. There are questions re:; ownership of wood. It may or may not be a salvage issue. R2 has drafted an outline for how we might address the wood issue and move forward with a Study Plan. In the next week, the woody debris (most is less than one foot in diameter) will be removed from the Lower Baker forebay. It will be dragged over to the boat launch where it will de-water. Some members believe that the amounts of gravel and large woody debris are important natural processes and need to be quantified. We need to determine the influence of the project on large woody debris and what to do about it. Sue will flesh out a budget and proposed scope for quantifying large woody debris and button up with Cary. Not discussed at this meeting. Status as of October meeting: Study Request is under review. No longer necessary due to change in management direction re: stocking of Baker Lake. Not discussed at this meeting. Status as of October meeting: Study Request needs clarification. In process of conducting the study, R2 has received hydrologic data from Bob Barnes. Are responding to comments from the Forest Service. We’ll be basing analysis of the Skagit River on existing information. Still awaiting a collection permit. This is TIME SENSITIVE for this spring! We agreed to discuss Study Plan offline. Stan is rewriting this to include other species. We don’t want to miss this year’s plankton bloom. Stan will send this out for review by 6 of 8   month end. Pending review, we will move this forward to study design, combining it with similar studies. A27 Middle Skagit Incubation Flows Not discussed at this meeting. Status as of October meeting: Covered in A9. A28 Fish Passage-Reservoir Management This is being further developed in the Fish Passage Technical Working Group.
