The focus of the discussion  Baker River Project Relicense Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 3.8.01_fishWG_notes.doc; Lyn Wiltse  2 of 5   was on the effects of dam operations and how they have diminished fish habitat and functions over the years.  STUDY REQUEST SUBMITTALS/STUDY REQUEST TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP Stan, Nick, Arnie, Karen, Bill, Chuck, Rod, Brady and Cary formed a technical working group to review study requests and make recommendations on which ones should be done in the 2001 field season.

They got together on February 22nd to review all 2001 field season study requests and make recommendations to this group.
