They are working on downstream fish passage facilities at Upper & Lower Baker. They are currently amassing baseline information and looking at data needs to be collected that would impact design at range of options. Preliminary estimates for the gulper option range from $3MM to $9MM. Preliminary estimates for V Screens range from $65MM to $104MM. They are trying to get the percentage of passage to above 95%. The design is focused on Chinook (weakest fish).  There was concern that the Technical Working Group may be too narrow in its scope. For example, they should include non-game species. Their minutes are available on the Web site. They will also be distributed at the September 14, 2000 meeting.  BAKER RIVER FISH DOCUMENT UPDATE The Baker River fish document is complete. Nick is duplicating CDs for all team members. It was suggested that PSE provide a few paper copies that could reside in a library for review.  ISSUES/INTERESTS A listing of interests was begun from the discussion of mission statements and goals.
