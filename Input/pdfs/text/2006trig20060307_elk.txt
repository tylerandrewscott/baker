WELCOME / INTRODUCTION OF NEW FACES We welcomed Tom Macy, the new Lands Program Manager for RMEF for Washington and Oregon, and Brock Applegate, our “new Lauri,” who works in the Major Projects group for WDFW. Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Elk Teamlet Meeting Notes, March 7, 2006 Page 1 of 4 REPORT ON OLD ACTION ITEMS: Tony discussed the question of using PSE elk money on fencing, pointing out that in addition to land acquisition money, we also have $50k per year earmarked for land management. At $10k/mile for fencing materials, fencing may be an appropriate use of management money, not acquisition money. PSE’s intent is that this group determines the expenditures within the goals of the Settlement Agreement. LAND ACQUISITION UPDATE Mike Mueller (RMEF) has continued contact with the landowner of the desired initial parcel, and is being careful not to press too hard. Mike and Tom are transitioning the relationship with the landowner from Mike to Tom. The landowner is still considering alternatives to an outright sale. Tony and Tom have visited this property and others in the general area to view the properties and discuss the various options. The group discussed the options it would consider relative to our land acquisition interest, including the following: Life Estate, Conservation Easement, Outright Purchase, Trust, and/or Long-term Lease possibilities. Each option would be subject to determination of compliance with FERC requirements for the license, and with conditions of the Settlement Agreement. If we entertain an alternative to outright purchase, we discussed acceptable and unacceptable uses. Ultimately, our goal is in getting the best-case scenario for elk with the money we have. We would want to restrict non-farming ATV & equipment uses Livestock – limited if at all, preferably 1½ months mid-summer Additional development – not preferred, but is an option if located for minimal impact and necessary for a deal to be struck Land Management – must have permission for active management for elk benefit Tom and Mike will use these interests to equip the RMEF with a list of possibilities to discuss with the landowner of the desired initial parcel and other owners of potential acquisition properties. We’re looking for good winter habitat (for forage more than for cover) because that’s most limited by development. We also would consider summer forage options we can actively manage for elk that may use areas year-around. Tony then reviewed WDFW’s input from last meeting, and the Settlement Agreement language, for the benefit of new members at the meeting. Basically, if we choose land in the core area, WDFW’s area wildlife biologist has expressed support, since it would be outside of identified elk damage areas. If we want to buy in the periphery, especially near lowland areas near the Skagit River, we may need to provide fencing or other damage prevention measures and run the risk of the adjoining areas being managed for urban growth and agriculture in the future and not for elk habitat. The WDFW is also interested in us acquiring lands east and south of the town of Concrete (Sauk area). ALTERNATIVE LAND OPTIONS We looked at the aerial photo and ownership maps, and discussed possible alternatives to our original land preference. The geographic area we are focusing our initial acquisition in if from the west shoreline of Lake Shannon, south of the Whatcom/Skagit county line, and within the Baker River and Grandy Creek drainages. DNR and Sierra Pacific own most of the land in the northern portion of this area. We discussed the possibility of buying timber land without buying the timber … with a plan to actively Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Elk Teamlet Meeting Notes, March 7, 2006 Page 2 of 4 manage the property for elk after the harvest. This option has drawbacks in terms of expense of management, but is another possibility for consideration. Much of the land is already zoned industrial forest, which is good for elk. Other small areas further up the drainage (Whatcom County) and at higher elevation are managed for old growth and makes good summer forage. In Skagit County we’d like to preserve land that is at greatest risk (those that are more inviting to development), with emphasis on lowland areas that provide winter forage. Our Priorities for Land Acquisition: Bear Creek plateau area, plateau near Vogler Lake, area around Lake Tyee Quality lowland forage areas in the Skagit valley (note: will have damage issues to address) Avoid “Islands,” so look for areas above lower area to create connectivity Concentrate on pasture/timber lands adjacent to existing big blocks of elk-friendly land Complement others’ elk and conservation efforts Could get “no development” easements to if landowner unwilling to sell Explore opportunity to get “First Right of Refusal” of attractive land not currently for sale Look for opportunities for Public Education (at viewing areas) Thunder Creek may be a possibility (discuss at next meeting) Take longest-possible view … keep in mind future uses of others’ land Maximize “Bang for our Buck” (easements, agreements, etc) Avoid creating/exacerbating problems, whether or not the problem is “ours” (ex: Hwy 20) Based on this, our Primary Focus for Alternative Sites (assumes initially selected property not available): Select areas in the lower portion of our geographic area Bear Creek plateau Areas to increase connectivity Talk to Tony about specific properties and ownerships under consideration. NEXT STEPS Tony, Marty & Tom will use these preferences to guide RMEF’s approach to land owners, and will keep the group informed of any developments. Our next meeting is set for May 15; if anything “hot” happens, we will meet April 26 instead. Tony will let us know.
