TOUR DEBRIEF : Those who attended said the tour was very complete. Ken distributed a sign-up sheet for those who were unable to attend, so we can schedule a make-up date.  PSE PRESENTATION Ed thanked the group for their energy and participation over the last few months. Joel gave an overview of how investor owned utilities operate. Ed concluded the presentation by discussing the idea of collaboration. He recommended the following article:  "Collaborative Processes for Improving Land Stewardship and Sustainability," by Mark Hummel and Bruce Freet, Ecological Stewardship: A Common Reference for Ecosystems Management, Volume I-III . Editors: N.C. Johnson, A.J. Malk, W.T. Sexton, R.C. Szaro. Publisher: Elsevier Science Ltd., Netherlands, 1999.  Pending copyright issues, PSE will make copies of the article to distribute at the October meeting. Ed also shared PSE's interests with the group. He stressed his support of the collaborative process and asked team members to give him a call at any time if they have questions. His direct number is 425-462-3022. The question was raised re: PSE's plans for potential structural modifications to increase power production at the Baker River Project. The only thing that may be on the horizon is possibly adding another turbine at Lower Baker (The new turbine would likely tap off the existing penstock). Handouts of the presentation were distributed and will be available on the website.  ANNOUNCEMENTS The RESOLVE Training addresses issues and interests and decision making styles within the collaborative process. This training is suggested for all working group members and IS REQUIRED for Solution Team Members. Dates for the training are Friday, October 13th at the U.S. Forest Service Office at Mountlake Terrace and on Saturday, October 21st at Cottontree Inn, Mount Vernon, WA. Team leaders will be calling all interested parties and asking them which date works best for them to attend the training. There is a limit of 40 participants in each training. The sessions will run from 9:00 to 4:00 and lunch will be provided. In the meantime, Ken distributed up a sign-up sheet for those who were ready to sign up.
