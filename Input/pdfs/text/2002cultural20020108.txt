BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 01/08/02 MEETING Cultural and Historic Resources Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 2   GIS COVERAGE MAPS • Tony explained GIS coverages that are available. We’ll be able to turn data layers on and off. • These are draft maps, which will incorporate other elements (such as recreation sites). • Tony noted the Recreation Working Group has recorded over 200 dispersed recreation sites. Most are above high water mark. The group has GPS locations for them. Most are within ¼ mile of the shoreline. • Recreation Working Group identified a zone to look for dispersed sites in, but did not make a determination if sites are project induced. • Bob noted that project induced use of a site is different than a project induced site. • Janis noted that we need to note which recreation sites may affect heritage sites in the area. • Criteria have not been established for deciding which recreation sites are project induced. • Terrestrial Working Group is possibly going to examine a subset of dispersed recreation sites and wetland areas to examine project effects on rare plants. • Cultural Working Group needs to see raw data on locations of dispersed recreation sites. CONFIDENTIALITY ISSUES • Jessie read letter from Scott Schuyler, requesting on behalf of the Upper Skagit Tribe that the Cultural Working Group postpone meetings until the confidentiality issue is resolved and the Communications Protocol & Process Document are finalized. • Connie gave status on confidentiality issue in Communications Protocol and Process Document. • PSE needs to report back to Cultural Working Group regarding discussions with Upper Skagit and see if there is consensus for continuing meetings. UDP -INTERIM PROTECTION • Jessie reported that Jan Hollenbeck called and noted that project development and maintenance on Forest Service lands triggers Section 106 and this is not covered in the UDP. Jessie responded that other interim measures, not the UDP, would cover this. Most of these measures will be in the Cultural Resources Management Plan, but Jan sees need for these measures earlier. Janis will clarify this with Jan. Jessie said the working group has discussed the need for an interim protocol for project development and maintenance activities and intends to address it. The agreement between the Forest Service and PSE dates from the 1950s and does not provide adequate guidance. • Gail and Tony suggested preparing a set of procedures for the transition period in collaboration with PSE operations staff. MEMBER LEAVING Jessie noted that John Boggs has decided to leave the relicensing process. We will stay in touch with him and hopefully he will return to the process in the future. Alex noted that being able to meet with John during the archaeological survey enriched the experience, and John also went out of his way to provide a tour of the museum for some of the crew. Jessie noted he also reviewed every document the working group produced.  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 01/08/02 MEETING Cultural and Historic Resources Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 3   DISCUSSION OF AREA OF POTENTIAL EFFECTS (APE) • Alex explained the Area of Potential Effects map. Tony clarified property ownership around Baker Lake and Lake Shannon. Much of the property around Lake Shannon above elevation 440 is not owned by PSE. The group discussed procedures for survey on non-PSE land, including asking permission and disclosure that sites would be recorded. • There is still no resolution from FERC regarding whether the T-lines will remain within the project boundary. • Next step is to overlay dispersed campsites and see where the APE needs to be expanded. Tribal input is also needed, including input on visual impact. Tony suggested this issue could be forwarded to the Recreation Working Group as part of their Aesthetics study. • Tribes also may have concerns about survey up the drainages, above creek mouths. Gail noted that we need to clarify whether such survey is triggered by archeological concerns or TCP concerns. • Separate discussion with the Tribes on the APE is needed. PARKING LOT • “How do we address upland areas?” • Map of general project area, include transmission lines • Upland area—importance of mountain goat • Keys to access Shannon and Baker Lakes and gates up lake • Develop “Area of Potential Effects” Map • Coordinate with Terrestrial and Recreation Working Groups • Glossary of terms: what are “protection,” “mitigation,” and “enhancement”? • Develop TCP (Traditional Cultural Properties) studies • Gail to give a presentation on procedures for inventorying and evaluating cultural resources • Familiarization with policies, directives, regulations, laws and interests • Define all applicable jurisdictions, laws and regulations • Cultural for DNR Land • Cultural aspects of Forest and Fish Agreement • Rotate meeting locations to tribal facilities? • Have tribal presentations on cultural/spiritual significance of resources • Possibility of transplanting young cedar trees • Availability of downed cedar for tribal use MEETING EVALUATION Well-Dones • Connie’s facilitation • Tony’s participation • Background information on Confidentiality issue. • Group discussion and willingness to talk over issues • Kristen’s sheet tearing • No flooding in this part of Sedro-Woolley • Forest Service meeting facility.
