If joining via your computer, you have the option of streaming the sound through your computer, or turning the sound off and dialing in separately. I suggest if you are signing into Lync to select the “without audio” link if you plan to call in on your phone (so you don’t have 2 audio links or you will get echo). With Lync, meeting initiators and meeting participants can share their desktops for demonstrations. If using an older PC check and make sure Microsoft Silverlight is installed. Also, to prevent connection interruptions, do not allow your PC to time-out (sleep), either by moving the mouse frequently, or temporarily configuring in the Power options to not time-out. Let me know if you plan to attend through the Lync online meeting or by phone, or plan to attend in person.
