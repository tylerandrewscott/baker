Deborah provided an overview of general collections and data management issues. TCP TRAINING Jessie gave us an update on the National Preservation Institute Traditional Cultural Places Training in San Francisco. She, Connie, and Ed Schild for PSE will be attending along with various tribal representatives including Larry Campbell (Swinomish), Jason Joseph (Sauk Suiattle), and Scott Schuyler and Doreen Maloney (Upper Skagit). They leave this Sunday for the two-day training. ROSS LAKE PRESENTATION Bob Mierendorf gave an interesting and informative presentation about the Ross Lake archaeological work. He discussed reservoir effects on archaeological sites and shared some of the mitigation measures that Seattle City Light agreed to. Historically no salmon have made it past the gorge all the way into Ross Lake. Bob and his crew discovered 165 archeological sites (some with artifacts as early as 9-10,000 years ago) within the approximately 11,000 acres surveyed. They did not include Canada in their survey as they lacked the necessary permits. BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 10/9/01 MEETING Page 2 L Wiltse for Cultural and Historic Resources Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150 ARCHAEOLOGICAL SLIDE PRESENTATION Gary Wessen began his presentation by reviewing an updated map of the APE for Baker Lake and Lake Shannon. Throughout his presentation, he compared and contrasted Baker Lake and Lake Shannon with Ross Lake. He noted the delta formations at the north (upper end) of both lakes. Whereas most of the sediment deposits/flats were on the east side of Ross, they were found to be on the west side of Baker and Shannon (probably due to a combination of solar exposure and slope). Other differences: only the upper end of Baker is pristine forest, whereas pristine forest was predominant surrounding Ross Lake. The logging has been more extensive at Shannon than at Baker. Baker has a volcano component that Ross lacks. This likely contributed to the original creation of Baker Lake. Bob also noted that Gorge and Diablo Lakes contain many of the fine-grained deposits that Gary found in Lake Shannon. He suggested that Ross Lake seems to be unique due to its great size and small area of active glacier drainage. Ross has no known winter villages, whereas they have been noted ethnographically at Baker. There was considerable discussion around the necessity of surveying steep slopes in the drawdown zone. Paleontology remains can also be likely found on steep slopes. Bob wants folks surveying in the field to include steep slopes. This is necessary in order to note color changes that the naturally occurring rocks in the areas undergo through the aging process. In order to do a good survey, you need to be a bit of a natural historian. Unfortunately Gary also found lots of evidence of dispersed camping and off-road vehicle activity. He will be recommending periodic re-examination of the various landforms over the period of the license. The frequency of monitoring will be tied to the rate of change on the various surfaces. DISCUSSION OF AREA OF POTENTIAL EFFECT (APE) Alex (HRA) brought the latest version of the draft map of the APE. The most recent version of the GIS maps have the survey areas on them so we now have the approximate acreage for the areas that have been surveyed on both lakes. All the sites are recorded on the maps. PREVIEW OF POTENTIAL 2002 STUDIES · Continue with archaeological survey (upland areas, testing). Resolve APE. · Historic Buildings and Structures (defer part to 2003?) · TCP and ethnobotany study (Skagit System Cooperative) in consultation with tribes (proceed with RFP) · Geomorphology study (partner with Forest Service proposal for study/Aquatics Working Group) PARKING LOT · “How do we address upland areas?” · Map of general project area, include transmission lines · Upland area—importance of mountain goat · Keys to access Shannon and Baker Lakes and gates up lake BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 10/9/01 MEETING Page 3 L Wiltse for Cultural and Historic Resources Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150 · Develop “Area of Potential Effects” Map · Coordinate with Terrestrial and Recreation Working Groups · Glossary of terms: what are “protection,” “mitigation,” and “enhancement”? · Develop TCP (Traditional Cultural Properties) studies · Gail to give a presentation on procedures for inventorying and evaluating cultural resources · Familiarization with policies, directives, regulations, laws and interests · Define all applicable jurisdictions, laws and regulations · Cultural for DNR Land · Cultural aspects of Forest and Fish Agreement · Rotate meeting locations to tribal facilities? · Have tribal presentations on cultural/spiritual significance of resources · Possibility of transplanting young cedar trees · Availability of downed cedar for tribal use MEETING EVALUATION Well-Dones · Location · Food and fire · Janis! · Jan! · Warning of Concrete speed trap · Gary’s presentation · Picked up momentum (after 2 months off) · Ardis! · Nice spirit- our differences aren’t divisive Opportunities for Improvement · No Mariner update AGENDA FOR NEXT MEETING— November 13, 2001, from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. at PSE Office in Mt.
