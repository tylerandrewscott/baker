INTRODUCTIONS We welcomed presenter: Dr. Asit Mazumder, Dept.of Biology at the University of Victoria, Mizan Rashid of ENSR, Kristen Kearnes, PSE intern, and Mike Ficklin, who works at the Baker River Plant and has assisted with the data collection. UPDATE FROM SOLUTION TEAM MEETING RESOLVE Sessions The majority of the meeting was spent discussing how the RESOLVE sessions were going. The Solution Team agreed to change the process so that the Working Groups get a chance to review/approve the license article language (drafted by the Louis-Berger Group) before it is sent to the Solution Team. Flood Control Lloyd reported that a teamlet of the USACE, Skagit County and PSE has been formed to address the issue of the flood feasibility study (approach and scope). They agreed that Tetra Tech will be writing the feasibility study and the Washington Group will be addressing any associated  Baker River Project Relicense Aquatic Resources Working Group File:7:10:03; Lyn Wiltse  2 of 9   physical changes to project works. If the benefit/cost ratio isn't compelling, no future action would be taken. The initial emphasis will, therefore, be on economics. By early September, we will know if the economics pan out. If they do, the Economics/Operations Working Group will review the findings and agree on next steps. Next steps might include a comprehensive environmental costs/benefits assessment which would begin in the November time frame. At their June meeting, the Economic/Ops Working Group reviewed a preliminary paper put out by R2 outlining some of the environmental impacts associated with flood control. (Arnie will see that Aquatics Working Group members get copies of this paper.) Solution Team members expressed concern about a possible resource drain on already scarce resources supporting other parties of the re-licensing process. Schedule of Study Plan Reports Phil walked us through the draft schedule he put together for study plan reports. This schedule will be sent to Solution Team members. Presentation by Dr. Asit Mazumder-Baker Lake Aquatic and Sockeye Salmon Productivity Dr. Asit Mazumder started his presentation of the report for this study with an overview of the nutrient foodweb dynamics and juvenile sockeye production. He reviewed productivity relationships learned in other systems. He showed the relationships between algal biomass, daphnia size, fry and smolt size and density to fry stocking and fertilization. Asit then reviewed the specific objectives of the Baker productivity study. Based on Asit's analysis of data for nutrients and zooplankton, Baker Lake productivity is currently not limited by nutrients or resources and the concentration of nutrients is at or above average levels observed among some of the most productive sockeye systems. He noted the large Baker smolt sizes and high biomass of large zooplankton and his interpretation is that the Baker population is lower than the system's current carrying capacity and fertilization would not be the best enhancement practice at this stage. Data from 1984 to 2000 indicate that zooplankton and daphnia biomasses are very positively correlated to smolt size. Large smolts are associated with high smolt-to-adult survival. However, he noted that in the Baker System, we are seeing a smaller percentage of fry surviving to smolt than is observed in other sockeye systems (Washington, BC and Alaska). We are also seeing a lower percentage of adult returns than would be expected given the large smolt size. Something seems to be happening down stream that is affecting adult returns. Asit finished his presentation by listing the following results/interpretations: <b7> Based on data for nutrients and zooplankton, Baker Lake productivity is currently not limited by nutrients or resources. <b7> The concentration of nutrients is at or above average levels observed among some of the most productive sockeye systems. <b7> Given the high biomass of large zooplankton and large smolt size, fertilization will not be the best enhancement practice at this stage.  Baker River Project Relicense Aquatic Resources Working Group File:7:10:03; Lyn Wiltse  3 of 9   <b7> Given the significantly larger than optimal size (80-90 mm) of smolts and abundant large zooplankton, Baker Lake sockeye population appears to be significantly lower than its current carrying capacity. <b7> Beach spawning seems to be very efficient in producing large number of fry, but the percent of fry surviving to smolt is much lower than average sockeye lakes in Washington, BC and Alaska He listed what he saw as major data gaps. Major gaps included data for smolt age structure and size distribution; zooplankton data (samples were taken only from top 10 meters); depth profile of nutrients; the percent of phosphorus that is due to glacier flour; trophic roles of coho, rainbow, kokanee in determining productivity of sockeye smolts; and, causes for low fry to smolt survival. He ended with a list of suggested one-to-two year studies which might address these gaps. In summary, the Baker Lake System (including Lake Shannon) does not seem to be a good candidate for fertilization. It appears that it would be able to sustain higher numbers of smolts without doing any fertilizing. Asit's sense is that predation loss could be a large contributor to the system. After the report is finalized, it will be available on the web. In the meantime, all were asked to let Arnie know if they'd like a hard copy of Asit's presentation. FISH PASSAGE TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP REPORT Nick reported that the first Floating Surface Collector is scheduled to be installed at Upper Baker in 2007 and Lower Baker in 2008. Many distinct technical working groups (focusing on design details, performance standards, etc.) will be meeting over the next several months. The scope and schedule for the fish passage facilities will be reviewed by this group before going to the Solution Team. The actual cash outlays resulting from the schedule will begin once we know we have a settlement. There will be an Expert Workshop July 22 and 23 at the Baker Lake Lodge. INSTREAM FLOWS TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP REPORT (A9) The Instream Flows Technical Working Group met on June 30. Minutes from this meeting should be out next week. There are three main components to the Middle Skagit River Habitat Models: hourly flow routing; (expected to be complete by July 18), hourly habitat (expected to be complete by August 15), and daily habitat (expected to be complete by September 19). The team was in agreement to going forward with the proposed models. HYDROPS hourly output will be supplemented by tables showing stage and flow for each of the 24 transects. Phil announced that there will be an executable program available as of July 18, that will allow you to create your own tables. Let Phil know if you'd like a copy of this program.
