Dave is available to help. <b7> Lloyd: Develop high level scope/schedules for potential environmental assessment of flood management change impacts.

Chuck will assume Rod Sakrison's role. REPORT ON OLD ACTION ITEMS Lloyd: Set up presentation on how PSE operates including trading in September or October time frame.  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 2150 10/8/2003 MEETING NOTES L Wiltse for Economics/Operations Working Group.  Page 2   Lloyd: Sent folks (or posted on Website) Charlie Black's presentation on the PSE Lease Cost Plan filed with WUTC. Lloyd: Confirmed all received Draft Proposed Actions for PDEA and the June 23rd revision. STATUS/ROLE OF ECONOMIC/OPERATIONS WORKING GROUP Lloyd saw the role of this group as providing review of the draft and final PDEA, License Application (in particular the Developmental Analysis and Economics sections of the Application), and PSE operations sections. We will be reviewing the overall Project economics and any PMEs that impact Project operations (e.g., in stream flows, etc.) Note: Comments on the PDEA are due by January 2, 2004 as the FERC notice was issued October 2, 2003. DRAFT PRELIMINARY DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT ASSESSMENT: DEVELOPMENT COSTS <ad>Mark Killgore Mark walked us through a PowerPoint presentation of the Developmental Analysis for the Baker project. He explained that the report includes best available data as of July 2003 (including a PSE operating 15foot flood buffer that has since been revised to eight feet). Since then, we have additional information provided by improved HYDROPS runs, many of the PMEs have been refined by the resource working groups. PSE is in the process of issuing an updated Least Cost Plan. Adjustments will be made to reflect these updates in the next version of the document. Preliminary Conclusions from the report: <b7> The net effect of implementing the Draft Action is a $8,292,300 reduction in the net annual levelized value of the Project (about 29 percent of the net benefit) without inflation. <b7> $10,535,600 reduction (about 29 percent of the net benefit) with inflation included. PSE BAKER DAILY OPERATIONS REVIEW Gene Galloway (PSE Manager Hydro Operations) and Anna Miles (PSE Electric Trader) presented a PowerPoint review of PSE operations. Their two departments are working closely together to coordinate optimal reservoir operations while minimizing risk to ratepayers. The trading floor is manned 24/7. Note: The data in this presentation were based on the 1929 vertical datum. TST UPDATE Paul reported that this group is continuing to meet twice a month. Their next meeting is October 10. They are currently re-doing runs according to some changes to assumptions to the HYDROPS model. They are also considering downstream habitat models developed by R2.
