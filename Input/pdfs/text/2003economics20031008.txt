Then draft Econ/Ops schedule for completion of critical path. • ALL: Review Mark’s presentation and send any questions to Lloyd so Mark can be prepared to address them at our November 12 meeting. • ALL: By November 12th: review Chapter 6 of PDEA for PMEs and License Application for completeness and review other sections of the PDEA of particular concern to your entity and provide analysis and comments. • Lyn: Ask Team leaders to flag potential “big Ticket” PME measures for this group and also to note those that impact Project operations. • Lloyd: Work up status of PMEs listed in matrix from econ/ops perspectives and be ready to report at our next meeting. Dave is available to help. • Lloyd: Develop high level scope/schedules for potential environmental assessment of flood management change impacts. INTRODUCTIONS We welcomed first-time attendees Lorna Ellestad, Gene Galloway, Anna Miles, Jay Smith, and Beth Coffey. Beth will be assuming Bruce Sexauer’s role in this process. Chuck will assume Rod Sakrison’s role. REPORT ON OLD ACTION ITEMS Lloyd: Set up presentation on how PSE operates including trading in September or October time frame. BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 2150 10/8/2003 MEETING NOTES Page 2 L Wiltse for Economics/Operations Working Group. Lloyd: Sent folks (or posted on Website) Charlie Black’s presentation on the PSE Lease Cost Plan filed with WUTC. Lloyd: Confirmed all received Draft Proposed Actions for PDEA and the June 23rd revision. STATUS/ROLE OF ECONOMIC/OPERATIONS WORKING GROUP Lloyd saw the role of this group as providing review of the draft and final PDEA, License Application (in particular the Developmental Analysis and Economics sections of the Application), and PSE operations sections. We will be reviewing the overall Project economics and any PMEs that impact Project operations (e.g., in stream flows, etc.) Note: Comments on the PDEA are due by January 2, 2004 as the FERC notice was issued October 2, 2003. DRAFT PRELIMINARY DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT ASSESSMENT: DEVELOPMENT COSTS –Mark Killgore Mark walked us through a PowerPoint presentation of the Developmental Analysis for the Baker project. He explained that the report includes best available data as of July 2003 (including a PSE operating 15- foot flood buffer that has since been revised to eight feet). Since then, we have additional information provided by improved HYDROPS runs, many of the PMEs have been refined by the resource working groups. PSE is in the process of issuing an updated Least Cost Plan. Adjustments will be made to reflect these updates in the next version of the document. Preliminary Conclusions from the report: • The net effect of implementing the Draft Action is a $8,292,300 reduction in the net annual levelized value of the Project (about 29 percent of the net benefit) without inflation. • $10,535,600 reduction (about 29 percent of the net benefit) with inflation included. PSE BAKER DAILY OPERATIONS REVIEW Gene Galloway (PSE Manager Hydro Operations) and Anna Miles (PSE Electric Trader) presented a PowerPoint review of PSE operations. Their two departments are working closely together to coordinate optimal reservoir operations while minimizing risk to ratepayers. The trading floor is manned 24/7. Note: The data in this presentation were based on the 1929 vertical datum. TST UPDATE Paul reported that this group is continuing to meet twice a month. Their next meeting is October 10. They are currently re-doing runs according to some changes to assumptions to the HYDROPS model. They are also considering downstream habitat models developed by R2.

REPORT ON OLD ACTION ITEMS SKAGIT COUNTY COMMENTS ON OCTOBER 8TH MEETING ECONOMICS AND OPERATIONS WORKING GROUP Lloyd: Set up presentation on how PSE operates including trading in September or October time frame. Lloyd: Sent folks (or posted on Website) Charlie Black’s presentation on the PSE Lease Cost Plan filed with WUTC. Lloyd: Confirmed all received Draft Proposed Actions for PDEA and the June 23rd revision. STATUS/ROLE OF ECONOMIC/OPERATIONS WORKING GROUP Dave mentioned that he asked that we discuss this topic as a result of the last Solution Team meeting where it was mentioned that there was an interest in pulling some items from the working groups in an effort to speed up the settlement process. Dave was concerned that we were not meeting the expectations of the other working groups and he wanted to reevaluate our mission and to develop a work plan and schedule that is consistent with the other working groups and settlement timelines. Lloyd saw the role of this group as providing review of the draft and final PDEA, License Application (in particular the Developmental Analysis and Economics sections of the Application), and PSE operations sections. We will be reviewing the overall Project economics and any PMEs that impact Project operations (e.g., in stream flows, etc.) Note: Comments on the PDEA are due by January 2, 2004 as the FERC notice was issued October 2, 2003.

REVIEW STUDY REQUESTS R-01 Low flow augmentation (deferred pending possible resolution by others) R-02 Baker flood control study (Initial study request was deferred per 6/11 Econ Meeting Notes see page 5 “ We deferred discussion of the Skagit County sponsored Flood Control Study Request until after the results of the initial feasibility analysis”.) Flood Control Teamlet, now conducting initial phase of Feasibility Study (6/11 Econ Meeting Notes see page 4 – “If final feasibility study still shows an acceptable BC ratio and PDEA (e.g. no fatal environmental flaws), this would be introduced into the ALP process. If ALP process is positive leading to settlement discussions concerning additional flood storage and completed by settlement deadline the change would be included.” R-03 Examination of spawning and incubation flows in Skagit River (referred to Technical Scenario Teamlet (TST)). Stan expressed that this was underway.

[Clarification by Lloyd, see June 11, 2002 meeting notes]. Comment – It was my understanding that Stan Walsh requested that the scoping for these studies begin immediately so we are prepared to act following the results of the Feasibility Study. My notes show that the team as a whole and Lloyd agreed to do this. TENTATIVE AGENDA FOR NEXT MEETING November 12, 2003 at PSE Office, Mt.
