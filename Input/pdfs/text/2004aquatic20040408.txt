Set Agenda for May 13, 2004 (9:00-3:00 <ad> USFS Building in Mountlake Terrace) NEW ACTION ITEMS <b7> Cary: Verify that SNF.03 and .04 have been run with Skagit County's flood control storage of 150K acre feet. When these runs are complete, share the results. -Irena confirmed that SNF.03 was run with Skagit County's (prior) flood proposal of 140 K acre-feet, but it failed due to violating recreation reservoir levels and exceeding the flood rule curve in 1996. <b7> Lyn: Check with the Cultural Working Group re: flexibility of water levels to protect cultural resources <b7> Greta: Check with Jan Hollenbeck re: heritage resources <ad> Is there overlap with HPMP and shoreline erosion? <b7> Arnie: Follow up on who is issuing shoreline permits. Are they required for CZMA and 401? <b7> Arnie: Send out Instream Flows announcement of April 14, meeting from 9:00-12:00, including location asap. <b7> Arnie: Make changes to PME purpose statements and send to Legal Working Group to refer to for License Article language. <b7> Ruth: Email IHA handout to Arnie so he can include it with draft notes of this meeting. <b7> Cary: Re-visit the widest operating range possible (with new runners etc.) with Joel. <b7> Gary: Work on "back of the envelope" costs of proposed 3.1 PME by March 19th. <b7> Stan: Review 3.4.1 and suggest wording changes and send to Arnie to distribute by March 15. INTRODUCTIONS We welcomed Janne Kaje of Steward & Associates, on behalf of Skagit County, who joined us for the first time today. OLD ACTION ITEMS <b7> Steve: Checked with Ed M. re: height requirement for barrier dam. He reported that NMFS can rewrite this section and build in a variance to the 10 ft. height criteria. This means we may not necessarily have to raise the height of the barrier dam. <b7> ALL: Got comments on license article language to Arnie by March 16 so they could be passed on to the Legal Team. <b7> Lyn: Talked with Dee re: Legal Working Group meetings conflicting with other meetings, so that Solution Team members could attend.  Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Aquatics Resources Working Group, April 8, 2004 Page 2 of 5  April 8, 2004   <b7> Margaret: Put together purpose statement and detail of new HYDROPS run. Got to Paul by Tuesday, March 16. <b7> Arnie: Posted A25 on website. <b7> Paul: Emailed out L1, L2 and L3 and summary by Friday, March 19.  FISH PASSAGE TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP REPORT The group met at the Lodge on March 8 and 9th. A 30% design memo was distributed and reviewed. A new guide net is being deployed and positioned in the forebay. It is not yet attached to the Net Transition Structure. Divers are working on this. There will be an update on progress at their meeting next week.  POLICY TEAM MEETING(S) REPORT Instream Flow & Status of new/revised HYDROPS Runs Ruth reported that the data from the SNF.03 and .04 runs are being reviewed by the parties. The SNF series was put together in response to the high capital costs associated with the NMF runs. The aim behind this series was to find the ideal fit that addresses the core interests of all the stakeholders in the process.  SNF.01 <ad> Had one small turbine plus the existing turbine and modified operation range of 2.7K to 4.1K cfs. It had a lower maximum spawning flow with the same incubation flow as TNC.26. SNF.02 - Had one small turbine and an escape hatch/high flow trigger. If Baker hits less than 80% exceedence, it resets the minimum flow (varies by month).  SNF.03, 04 <ad> Added two small turbines (700-750 cfs capacity). The minimum range was from 600 to 1200 cfs, depending on the month. The maximum ranged from 3.2K to 5.6Kcfs. These runs provided similar fish protection along with improved economics. The capital costs exceeded PSE.02 by $13 million. There wasn't much change in generation, etc. Dependable Capacity is diminished somewhat in .03. It has not been calculated for .04 yet.  SNF.03 has an escape hatch, where as .04 does not. There is a lot of uncertainty around execution of an escape hatch. Cary suggested that maybe we focus future efforts around .04 because it doesn't include an escape hatch provision.  Ruth would like to suggest some refinements to these runs based on the IHA analysis. Ruth distributed a handout she put together to explore impact on IHA factors. The goal of her analysis was to reduce the size of the hydrologic alteration numbers in certain places.  At the last Policy Team meeting, Mike Stansbury (Skagit County) walked us through some manually calculated charts showing how their proposed flood regime would overlay with SNF.02. He did not include the 8 foot flood buffer that PSE uses to manage their adherence to flood control requirements. Folks expressed concern about some of the assumptions he used to illustrate the effects of increased flood control and agreed that it would be better to review HYDROPS run results to understand these effects.  Phil distributed a table of volumetric numbers for monthly flows for Baker River at Concrete, synthesized unregulated conditions, Energy Years 1926-2002. To achieve 74K acre feet of available flood control storage, you'd need to run 1244 cfs over a 30 day period in addition to inflow.  Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Aquatics Resources Working Group, April 8, 2004 Page 3 of 5  April 8, 2004   After some discussion, we agreed that good progress has been made and it is now time to reconvene the Instream Flows Technical Working Group with PSE's participation. This will allow us to work together to conduct a few more runs and analyze impacts on participant interests. Once we agree on a run, we will see how Skagit County's flood control proposal works with it. We set the next Instream Flows Meeting for Wednesday, April 14th from 9:00 -12:00 (location was determined later to be at the Seattle Airport Red Lion). RESOLVE: DRAFT PROPOSED ACTIONS We deferred discussion of these PMEs as they have passed into the realm of the Policy Team. 3.1.1 Provide Fish Propagation & Enhancement Not discussed. 3.4.1 Implement Fluvial Geomorphic Management Not discussed. Stan is still reviewing this and might suggest some alternate wording. 3.4.3 Shoreline Erosion Management Greta will check to see if there is overlap in scope between this PME and protection of heritage resources as called out in the Historic Properties Management Plan. 3.4.4 Aquatic Habitat Restoration Not discussed. STUDY UPDATES A16: Lower Baker River Alluvial Fan Assessment Phil reported that this study is in progress. It was suggested at our last meeting that we look at modifying project operations in an attempt to reduce scour. Phil said this would conflict with the USACE flood control operations. He expects the report to be out in June. A handout updating the schedule of studies, reports and relevant file names was distributed. We will look at this for setting the studies updates needed for the May Aquatics meeting. LEGAL TEAM We were told that the Legal Team requested purpose statements explaining the purpose or intent of the articles and which are to accompany the license article language they are reviewing. Arnie distributed proposed purpose statement language for each of the Aquatics draft license articles the Legal Team will be reviewing. We reviewed the proposed language, modified it and approved it for distribution to the Legal Team.
