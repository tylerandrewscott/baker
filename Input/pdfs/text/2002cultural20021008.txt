Vernon MEETING NOTES Mission: “To develop alternatives and recommendations addressing cultural, historical and archeological resources for the Baker River Project relicensing process.” Team Leader: Jessie Piper (425) 462-3609, jpiper@puget.com PRESENT: Jessie Piper (Puget Sound Energy), Connie Freeland (Puget Sound Energy), Bruce Freet and Dee Endelman (Agreement Dynamics), Chris Miss (North West Archaeological Associates), Lyn Wiltse and Mary Jean Bullock (PDSA Consulting, Inc.) FUTURE MEETING DATES NOTE: November 5 is the tentative date set for our next meeting (instead of November 12). Jessie will be calling you to see if November 5 works. November 22 is a back-up date in case November 5 doesn’t work. We are also looking at holding a 2-day meeting between our next meeting (Nov. 5 or 22) and the end of the year. We would hold this meeting at the Baker Lake Lodge and spend the first day on developing PMEs and the second day would be our regular meeting. Options for 2-day meeting: December 2 – PMEs; December 3 – Regular meeting or December 9 – PME; December 10 – Regular Meeting Jessie will be calling to see which dates work best for you. All regular attendees are encouraged to let Jessie know if they are unable to attend a meeting.

NEW ACTION ITEMS • Jessie: Check with members regarding proposed dates of next meetings (November 5 or 22 instead of November 12). • Jessie: Check with members re: recommendations to complete initial draft of APE. • Lyn: Call Jan Hollenbeck to check the status of ARPA permit and to verify that a cultural survey was done when the Forest Service constructed the Baker Lake Trail in the early 90’s. • Frank: Send Jessie sample PAs to share with this group. • Jessie: Review the Forest Service Watershed Analysis for info related to cultural resources. • Larry: Run Unanticipated Discovery Plan (draft) by Marty Loesch for feedback. • Jessie: Send out results from Aquatic Erosion Study when they become available. • Jessie: Check possibility of HYDROPS demonstration at a future meeting- January or February? • Jessie: Send out UDP for formal review. • Jessie: Researched trails etc. to suggest what to include in APE. • Jessie: Continue research on land ownership around Lake Shannon. • Jessie: Work with Tribes to confirm tribal crew members who will participate in archaeological work. REPORT ON OLD ACTION ITEMS • Jessie checked with Nick Verretto of the Aquatics Working Group re: their erosion study. See paragraph on next page. • Lyn invited Bruce and Dee to attend to discuss PME approach with this group. STATUS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY WORK Chris Miss of NWAA reported that she and her crew will be ready to begin surveying the adjacent area to Lake Shannon and the evaluation of the discovered sites there after October 18. When she receives the BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 10-08-02 MEETING Page 2 Cultural and Historic Resources Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150 ARPA permit, she can begin the same tasks for Baker Lake. We need to clarify land ownership (Lake Shannon) issues and APE definition before October 18th. PLAN FOR THIS MEETING Given the small attendance at this meeting, we decided to come up with recommendations to complete our preliminary definition of the APE and then discuss how we might solicit input from team members re: an appropriate approach to develop PMEs for this group. SUGGESTED APE APPROACH Jessie reminded us that so far we have agreed that the APE is a “living boundary” and subject to change over time, depending on what we find. Further, we have agreed that the APE is, at a minimum, the FERC boundary. For our definition, we have extended the APE to include dispersed recreation sites ¼ mile beyond the high water mark of the reservoir. We also agreed to draw “bubbles” around Project facilities and formal camping facilities to include them. We had planned to determine at this meeting: • Creek mouths (how far up?) • Trails and roads (which and how far?) • Articulation with uplands Jessie suggested that we look where there is a nexus among the various elements, as we could infer a Project effect where creeks, trails, campsites met. We would extend the APE to include these. Regarding uplands, passage up to these sites seems to link with streams and dispersed recreation sites. We would take this into consideration as we extend the APE. We might construct 100 meter polygons around these "convergence zones". It would adjust the APE to be inclusive of these areas (albeit a bit lumpy/bumpy.) We agreed that these recommendations made sense and that Jessie will run these by Working Group members prior to October 18th, so as not to hold up any archaeology work. AQUATICS EROSION STUDY The Aquatics Working Group is very interested in issues such as sediment transport, as well as the erosion/deposition information we are concerned with. They plan to have a preliminary report by December. Jessie is arranging to have one of the AESI representatives attend one of our meetings to review their findings with us. We could use these data to see where we might want to gather additional information. PME DEVELOPMENT Bruce and Dee will be working with us to help us develop PMEs for cultural/historical resources. At our November 5 or November 22 meeting they will meet with us to help determine the best approach If it doesn’t work for folks to meet on November 5 or November 22, they will call working group members to discuss considerations for PME development for this group. HANDOUTS There were no handouts at this meeting.
