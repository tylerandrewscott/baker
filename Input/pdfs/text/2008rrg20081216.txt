The exception will be when the third Tuesday follows a Monday holiday. In those cases, we will meet on the  Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 RRG Final Meeting Notes December 16, 2008  Page 1 of 4   fourth Tuesday. Since these meetings generally haven't started right at 9 a.m. anyway, the group decided to move the scheduled start time to 9:30, with the understanding that we will start on time. If the agenda is light, the group agreed that phone and/or video conferencing is an option; Pam will coordinate as needed.  Due to some upcoming tasks and their associated deadlines, RRG may need to meet in March (an extra meeting in the bi-monthly schedule). Pam will send out a draft 2009 meeting schedule with these notes, including the reminder to hold the 3rd Tuesday in March in case it is needed.  BRCC / License Update The BRCC met Oct. 22 to review the license, which was issued effective October 1, 2008, with a 50-year term. PSE is pleased to see that the license is materially consistent with our Settlement Agreement. Cary noted that the Settlement Agreement, 4(e) and 401 conditions, section 18, and IPP are all intact in the license FERC has issued.  The BRCC met again Nov. 19. Cary reported that Skagit County did not submit a request for rehearing to the license; PSE is working with them directly on flood storage planning / activities. A private citizen from La Conner did submit a letter to FERC outlining concerns about flood storage. PSE anticipates that FERC may interpret this letter as a request for rehearing, and will dismiss it as being without merit.  There was an update at the BRCC meeting about a brief flood event; this was discussed further at the ARG meeting last week. The group also discussed the process required to create the BRCC and associated resource groups. BRCC will officially form and establish the RRG, TRIG, ARG, and CRAG at their next meeting, January 28, 2009. You can read the Settlement Agreement Article 601 for details on this process.  Now that the license has been issued, "year one" funds are available. PSE is working internally to establish their budgetary process re: RAM funds.  The RRG discussed the decision-making process and the definition of what actual constitutes a formal decision, and asked PSE to present information at the February RRG meeting about how other resource groups are handling this issue.  Ann noted that PSE and USFS are in the process of clarifying their working relationship, both functionally and fiscally. The goal is to keep technical decisions at the Resource Group level, with the understanding that the Settlement Agreement will be implemented fully / transparently.  Lake Shannon Access: Brian shared that the county's perspective is that the Right of Way (ROW) to Lake Shannon is established. He gave Pam copies of the county's resolutions to share with PSE's legal dept. Pam attended the Oct. 27 meeting between PSE and Glacier NW (GNW) to firm up the easements for the lower road through GNW's limestone quarry and access to the boat launch. The two parties also discussed a PSE transmission line that runs across GNW land with an easement that is scheduled to expire February 2009. Pam shared that part of the difficulty is that some of the historical easements were handled informally and may not have clear definitions or survey data. GNW requested PSE's boundary surveys and tie-down plans for the FSC; PSE requested GNW's mining plan. GNW did indicate a willingness to extend the existing easement understanding for the transmission line.  Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project No. 2150 RRG Final Meeting Notes, December 16, 2008  Page 2 of 4   USFWS Consultation & Draft Proposal for Concurrence: In 2006, WDFW requested Marbled Murrelet and Spotted Owl surveys at the resort. PSE and USFS took the lead on this.  USFWS and USFS conducted a site visit in May; they discussed the characteristics of potential habitat (shelter / nesting trees, etc.) and noted areas of potential concern. PSE and USFS have been working on a proposal for concurrence with USFWS to ensure that tree removal and construction does not interfere with potential habitat and breeding / nesting. Pam brought copies of the draft Proposal for Concurrence that describes actions taken to avoid wildlife disturbance.  We discussed the value of involving USFWS in an informal consultation so PSE and USFS can understand and address any concerns before entering into the formal FERC consultation process. Pam will send the draft to Lou Ellyn Jones (USFWS) as soon as possible, by the first week of January at the latest. Haley (PSE) and Dave (WDFW) will coordinate another site visit in light of the updated plans, and Dave will invite Lou Ellyn to join them.  PSE / USFS will incorporate USFWS feedback and distribute an updated draft of the Proposal for Concurrence to the RRG in advance of the February RRG meeting. The RRG will review the updated draft before it is formally submitted to the USFWS.  We discussed timelines, FERC requirements, and what needs to be submitted by April 1, 2009 (high-level process document or detailed implementation plan). The group suggested we go with a mix of both, so we will submit the process plan April 1 along with a summary of the implementation plan.  Baker Lake Resort Redevelopment Plans: Construction needs are dictating a tight timeline; the plan must go to FERC by April 1, and the goal is to clearly define permitting requirements in advance to avoid surprises/delays.  PSE has received an extension of the special use permit, will operate the resort for one more year (summer 2009), and will then decommission it in advance of the redevelopment work. USFS will begin their internal planning (construction drawings, etc) in summer 2009; tree removal is planned for fall 2009; and construction will be underway through 2010 and should be complete in time for the 2011 season.  Ann walked the group through the updated redevelopment plan, highlighting the changes since the August RRG meeting. Adjustments have been made to minimize the impact to wetland habitat, improve aesthetics, and accommodate the wind and other site realities. Jamie Van De Vanter, Landscape Architect, conducted a site visit since the last RRG meeting to identify forested wetland areas and modified the road location to avoid disturbance to those areas. Density will be reduced from 91 camping sites to 50; this will reduce the need for hardening and meets the intent of Article 303. We noted that reduced capacity at the Baker Lake Resort might increase pressure on other sites.  Jamie V. pointed out aspects of the design that address community interest (esp. local interest) for day use sites for picnicking, etc. in the area. He also showed how the design clarifies the separation between the day use areas and the overnight areas. Circulation through the grounds and accessibility are also improved.  Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project No. 2150 RRG Final Meeting Notes, December 16, 2008  Page 3 of 4   We reviewed the decommissioning plan and noted the intent to save and re-use local vegetation wherever possible throughout the project. USFS anticipates the need for active weed management in the early years due to the extent of the disturbance. Dave stated that WDFW's concerns about wetland disturbance have been addressed with this redesign. Proposed Implementation Schedule Changes: At this time, the only schedule change USFS is proposing is to move Article 303 resort funding into "year one." This proposal is consistent with the current decommissioning and redevelopment plans presented / discussed today. Recreation Plan Development: We welcomed Sergio Capozzi, of EDAW Consulting, to the meeting. EDAW Consulting will be helping PSE write the plans and reports for six articles: 301, Recreation Management; 302, Aesthetics Management; 303, Baker Lake Resort Redevelopment Plan; 304, Baker Reservoir Recreation Water Safety Plan; 305, Lower Baker Developed Recreation; and 318, Law Enforcement. Sergio walked us through a high-level review of the schedule for these management plans and reports. The goal is to have all six ready to present to FERC within the first year of license issuance while being thoughtful about how the review periods are spaced to avoid overwhelming the agencies with multiple reviews at once. If this does not work, then the plans that are due within one year (Articles 304, 305, 318) will take priority.
