Our next face-to-face meeting is currently anticipated to be on in the spring of 2011. Also we are requesting topics of interest for the agenda. Please let me know. We will continue to reserve the 4th Wednesday each month for a conference call or face to face meeting as needed. Thanks again for your enthusiastic and dedicated participation, Cary BRCC update for November 2010 Aquatic Resource Group (ARG) The ARG met on November 9th at PSE's Skagit and Snoqualmie offices providing video-conferencing and Web-Ex connection. We heard an update from Mark Killgore on article 107c. We expect the first sample results of the consultant's analysis to be presented at the January ARG meeting. March ARG meeting will have the full suite of results for review and by April the complete post-IPP results. The final report is due to FERC in October 2011. Mark commented on the sample advisory PSE forwarded to the ARG in October, providing information regarding an upcoming potential flooding event. The intent was to share the information available and give folks a head's up. Scott Williams gave an update on the spawning beach 4 renovation and decommissioning of spawning beaches 1-3. The renovation work is completed, the contractors are demobilizing and PSE is engaged in some final testing. The beach decommissioning document has been provided to the ARG for input and will be passed through the CRAG next. R2 walked through highlights of article 108 gravel and article 109 large woody debris management plans which are out for the ARG to review. Comments are due in November and the plans will be submitted to FERC in January. file:///C|/...zahunti/LOCALS~1/Temp/A9R2893.tmp/Baker%20River%20Coordinating%20Committee%20Update%20for%20November.htm[1/6/2011 10:19:31 AM] Next, an update from the Fish Passage Technical Working Group reported on tracking design changes that were considered from the UB FSC design to the LB design, some related to site-specific considerations and others related to improvements on lessons learned from the UB FSC. They also reviewed results of the 2010 UB FSC performance evaluation and plans for the 2011 test. PSE provided a brief update on hatchery operations. Sockeye spawning, egg collection and incubation is well underway at the new hatchery and is going very well. Next, PSE reported on the status of other aquatic article plans and article annual reports that have been provided to the ARG or are coming due. Then the ARHWG convened at the conclusion of the ARG meeting to hear presentations from proponents of pre-proposals received for potential article 505 projects. The next ARG meeting is December 14th and is scheduled as a conference call. Terrestrial Resources Implementation Group (TRIG) The TRIG held a regular meeting on November 4th at the PSE office in Burlington. We agreed that PSE would be making quarterly budget updates, with the next update to be during the January TRIG meeting. We discussed at length details pertaining to the purchase of Property X. We worked out how much we would like to allow PSE to negotiate within, and the percent of funding from each of the acquisition articles (forest, elk, and wetlands). Two decisions were developed, and we set out a 2-week notice for a conference call to make the formal decisions. Decision #1 pertained to a limit of funding within which PSE could negotiate with the Property X owners, and Decision #2 was to agree on the percent funding from each article (20% from Forest, 78% from Elk, and 2% from Wetlands) for the purchase. The conference call was held on November 19th to formalize the two decisions, both which passed with a quorum and consensus. The Alder Creek Management Program document was finalized, and sent to the members via e-mail. A meeting of the Alder Creek Management Teamlet will take place during the last two hours of the December 2nd TRIG meeting to work on implementation of the program and development of DNR applications for upcoming management work. Scott gave an update on Botanical Teamlet activity, which included a review of both the Plants of Special Status and Carex flava management plans. and a discussion of reed canarygrass treatments. Two bald eagle night roost surveys have occurred in November, with one eagle seen perching on Lake Shannon during each survey. We finished up the meeting with a discussion of beginning implementation of Article 514 Effectiveness Monitoring on the Alder Creek property. Members are to brainstorm ideas for monitoring activities and bring them to the December TRIG meeting. The next TRIG meeting with be at the PSE Burlington office on December 2nd, from 9 A.M. until 2 P.M. Recreation Resources Group (RRG) RRG met on November 16 at the Baker Lake Lodge. RRG took a field trip to the Swift Creek Campground to see the progress made in the redevelopment by the USFS. The RRG approved by consensus to disperse an additional $50k of RAM funds to the USFS for completion of accessibility features at the resort. RRG will meet again in February. Water safety maps are set to be completed by year end and will be printed and dispersed at boat access sites and visitor centers in time for the 2011 recreation season.
