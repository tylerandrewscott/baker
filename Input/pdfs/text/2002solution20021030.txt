INTRODUCTIONS We welcomed Rob Mohn, Pam Klatt, Pat Weslowski (for the Louis Berger Group), and Steve Hocking and Mike Henry (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission). We also welcomed the PSE Working Group Team Leaders: Arnie Aspelund (Aquatics), and Tony Fuchs (Terrestrial); and Omroa Bhagwandin from the Olympia office of the Department of Natural Resources. SETTLEMENT PROCESS UPDATE Dee distributed summaries and walked us through the draft options for PMEs put together by three of the Working Groups (Terrestrial, Aquatics, and Recreation). She and Bruce will begin working with the Economics/Operations Working Group and the Cultural/Historical Working Group next month. These summaries will be attached to these minutes. Terrestrial Working Group: This Working Group discussed 85 ideas to address the following issues: • Effects of reservoir on wildlife & plants • Overall size of wildlife populations; Game Habitat; Wildlife species of special status; Undesirable wildlife • Wetlands • Forest Habitat: Hardwood Riparian and Late-Seral Coniferous • Connectivity • Snag and log habitat • Vegetation: Plant species of special status and Noxious weeds • Land Management Activities • Impact of Recreation • Flow Manipulation Impacts on Wildlife and Habitat Aquatics Working Group: This Working Group discussed 190 ideas to address the following issues: • Instream Flow Management • Reservoir Operations and Fluctuations • Anadromous Fish Passage • Hatcheries • Spawning and Rearing Habitat Restoration • Water Quality, Reservoir and Stream • Invasive/Alien Species Recreation Working Group: This Working Group discussed 69 ideas to address the following issues:  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 10/30/2002 MEETING NOTES Baker Solution Team-Lyn Wiltse, PDSA Consulting, Inc. Facilitator FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 3   • • • • •  Meeting Recreational Needs: Addressing Current Recreational Needs and Project Effects on Recreational Facilities and Opportunities Protecting Public Health and Safety in Recreational Areas Emergent Recreational Needs Addressing Visual and Aesthetic Impacts Addressing Inconsistencies between Project and Adopted Comprehensive Plans  SETTLEMENT PROCESS Bruce distributed a template he put together for Working Group members to use to frame PMEs for potential inclusion in a Settlement Agreement. We discussed this template and the instructions for participants to fill it out. He also distributed a possible outline for the settlement agreement called “A Framework for Agreement.” He’d like comments on the outline by Nov. 15. Bruce walked us through a PowerPoint presentation of “Dealing with Uncertainties.” It included a draft schedule of PME Products and Timeframes: Dec. ’02 1st draft PMEs Oct. ’03 2nd Draft PDEA Feb. ’03 2nd Draft PMEs Oct. ’03 FERC Pre-Terms, Conditions Mar. ’03 PMEs for PDEA & Recommendations Mar ’03 PMEs for Agreement in Principle Mar. ’04 Some Management Plans May ’03 1st Draft PDEA Aug. ’03 3rd Draft PMEs/Management Plans Bruce encouraged us to consider how to define an approach we want to take with regard to Adaptive Management. We will discuss this at our November 26 meeting. PDEA UPDATE Rob Mohn (the Louis Berger Group) outlined the following schedule of deliverables re: the PDEA: • Now – The Louis Berger Group resource leads are attending resource Working Groups and compiling and organizing the information being gathered through studies, etc. • November 2002 – Produce assessment report on adequacy of existing information for use in preparation of PDEA • December 2002 – Produce detailed outline of PDEA (FERC format) • Spring 2003 – Produce Preliminary PDEA (for internal/Baker Solution Team review) • Describe current environment • Describe “no action alternative” (continuation of current operations) • Fall 2003 – Produce Draft PDEA (for public review) • Accompanied by draft license application (FERC notice triggers a 90-day review period) • Spring 2004 – Produce final PDEA (to be submitted to FERC with the final License Application and Settlement Agreement) Kris asked that all consider if it would be an acceptable option for PSE to also consider using the Louis Berger Group to write the actual license application. Steve H. said that FERC would not consider this to be a conflict of interest. We will make a decision on this at our November meeting. BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 10/30/2002 MEETING NOTES Baker Solution Team-Lyn Wiltse, PDSA Consulting, Inc. Facilitator FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 4   REPORT ON OLD ACTION ITEMS • Dee: Sent out settlement process materials to members electronically. • Bruce: Drafted mechanism for Working Groups to use to get over the uncertainty hump with regards to some PMEs. • Rod: Compiled list of requirements for CZMA consistency determination and 401 Water Quality Certification and Shoreline Management Act permits. • Connie: Contacted NOAA, USFS, USFWS, Dept. of Ecology, OAHP re: submitting schedule for meeting deliverables for relicensing process. • Kris: Contacted Rick Miles/FERC re: being one of ten ALPs to be examined by the U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution. Connie will send out the date and location of a meeting with these folks when they are in the Seattle area. Anyone interested in joining in on this meeting to help determine if it makes sense for us to be included in this study should let Connie know. • Mike/Keith (FERC): By October 15, sent to Connie examples of adaptive management and settlement agreements from other proceedings. • Connie: Forwarded materials from Mike and Keith to Solution Team members for review. • Lyn: Buttoned up with Gene and Steve re: change of future meeting days. It looks like we will be changing from Wednesdays to Tuesdays. • Lyn: Talked to team leaders about putting attachments (like study list) on website. • Connie: Emailed updated Study Index matrices and posted on web. • All: Reviewed info on Solution Team membership list and sent changes to Connie. IPP/FLOWS REPORT: ESA UPDATE Cary reported that flows in the Northwest continue to be very low. PSE initiated flow management in August for chinook protection according to the Draft Interim Protection Plan. The plan calls for release of flows from a budget of water stored for supplementation. This part of the Plan has been in effect since the first part of October and continues today. PSE is releasing water in pulses to keep redds wet until rainfall returns to the region and Skagit River flows increase. PROCESS FOR 6-MONTH PROGRESS REPORT TO FERC The first report will be due January 19, 2003 (six months after we were granted permission to use the Alternative Licensing Process.) Steve Hocking advised us to keep the report simple and high level. We can reference documents posted on the website. The report should include the schedule and an update for each Working Group, including the Solution Team. Connie will share a draft of the first report with interested persons at our December 17 meeting. DEBRIEF FROM OCTOBER 29 MEETING: 4(E), SEC. 18, ESA Steve Hocking from FERC stated that the purpose of this meeting was to clarify schedule, critical pathways and authorities relating to 4(e), Section 18, and ESA. Also at the meeting, Marian Valentine gave a presentation of the Army Corps of Engineers’ flood control program for Upper Baker. That presentation is available on the website.

Facilitator FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 5   PREVIEW OF OCTOBER 31 MEETING : 401, CZMA The purpose of this meeting will be to do the same as described for the meeting above for 401 Water Quality Certification and CZMA consistency determination. This meeting will be held at the Department of Ecology in Bellevue from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. WHAT’S HOT IN THE WORKING GROUPS? AQUATICS • Flood planning leading to drought planning • “Without Project” approach CULTURAL • Is Working Group format working for this group? • Getting back to archaeological work RECREATION • PMEs (schedule) • Off road vehicles TERRESTRIAL • PME timeline • Getting studies done on time • We are! ECONOMICS • Flood control SCHEDULES/STUDIES INDICES/TIMELINES Connie distributed current versions of these. As these are now available on the website, PSE will bring only a limited number of hard copies to meetings and will provide a high-level index and schedule report at each meeting. Steve H. reminded us that we are on a critical path and that we need to make decisions rather than continuing to keep all options open. HYDROPS MODEL UPDATE Bob Barnes made a brief presentation of the HYDROPS model, including an explanation on how HYDROPS was used to determine the high, medium and low water years to be used for running scenarios for the Working Groups. He reminded everyone that the request forms to run various scenarios on this model are on the website. DISCUSS/REVISE MEETING SCHEDULE We moved our meetings from the fourth Wednesday to the fourth Tuesday of the month for 2003. The exception will be in January 2003, when we will meet on the third Tuesday (January 21).
