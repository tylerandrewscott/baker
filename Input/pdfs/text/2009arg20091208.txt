PREVIOUS, STILL RELEVANT, ACTION ITEM  Jed Reconvene a teamlet in April / May 2010 to address sockeye fry release strategies REVIEW OF AGENDA, NOTES, HANDOUTS The final notes were reviewed from the October meeting and accepted. BRICC / License Updates Cary emailed an update on the various resource group license implementation activities to BRCC members on December 1. The BRCC meeting schedule will continue to be the fourth Wednesday of each month. Depending on the amount of material to share, the BRCC will meet in person (at least semi-annually), by conference call, or review Work Group proceedings via email. Cary reported that each Working Group is continuing its work on implementation on the various resource articles. The PSE Baker License Website should be up in early 2010. ADULT FISH TRAP Frank Hella has been the Project Manager for the construction of the Adult Fish Trap. He is now assuming that role for the hatchery and Scott Williams will assume PM duties for the fish trap going forward. Frank walked us through some construction photos as he provided an update of recent activities relative to the construction of the trap. The photos can be made available to anyone who requests them (through Arnie). The existing trap has been operational during construction of the new trap which is scheduled to be complete by the end of May, 2010. FISH OPERATIONS Hatchery / Inventory and AI Operations Frank walked us through some recent photos of the Baker hatchery construction. He reported that they are now installing sheet rock, doors and windows in the hatchery building. The concrete pouring of the Artificial Incubation (AI) raceways is largely complete. Doug observed that construction contractors have been working well with the crew. Phase one of the hatchery will be complete in June of 2010. Doug reported that things are working well with the sockeye spawning as well. They will be spawning for two more weeks. After that they will shut down and drain the trout pond and a section of the retaining wall for the new hatchery will be constructed. Adult sockeye at spawning beach 4 have been removed per best practices. Due to an unfortunate issue with debris that made its way through the head works and into the inflow to the rainbow rearing ponds, Doug announced the loss of approximately half of the rainbow trout. Since becoming aware of the issue, the crew has been monitoring the situation on a daily basis, including the weekend. They have been opening valves at the head works to flush out debris and reduce flow going into the head box. These trout support a sport fishery in Depression Lake. It may be possible to get replacement trout from the Arlington hatchery (the original source). Doug reported that after the November release of sockeye, the population is now down to 5,000 (pre- smolt). There are 64,000 coho in the other raceway. They will use them for freeze branding and release them into the Skagit River in the spring. They are spawning Sockeye today for the AI program. The current count is around 900. The spawning will continue through the week of December 14. They have collected nearly 1 million eggs, so far. The spawning beach was cleared of sockeye on Dec. 3. They removed the live fish to limit the potential for vertical transmission of the IHN virus to the eggs in the gravel. In doing so, they took an additional 187,000 eggs from ripe females for the AI program. On December 9 they will take coho broodstock from the circulars and spawn them. There are 50K eggs to date that will go to incubation stacks. Doug reported that there was no problem in getting the number of broodstock coho for the program. They will continue spawning these until mid January. When we transition to the new hatchery facilities in May of 2010, most fish will have been released. They will have emergent fry. Raceways won’t be ready to go yet. The incubation stacks are on the domestic supply line, so there won’t be a concern about sediment in incubation stacks. In March they will begin testing various parts of the hatchery to get the ponds ready to receive sockeye broodstock at the normal return period. Renovation of sockeye spawning beach 4 will be completed by the end of 2010. Doug reported testing and training will occur in May so we will be ready to go for the first full fall season. REPORTS Arnie reported that the draft annual reports for License Articles 101 and 106 are out for review and he is receiving comments on them. The deadline for comments on Article 101 is today and for 106 is January 8, 2010. Phil announced that the zooplankton data collection under the 101c(1) sockeye smolt production capacity study proceeded without any problems. Samples have been sent off to the lab. We should get them back by the end of this year. He will provide an interim report on this at our February meeting. Low phosphorus counts have been consistent through all of the field trips. Phil also reported that bull trout genetic samples have been sent to the WDFW lab in Olympia. He will report on the mid-January meeting with USFWS at the update he provides at our February meeting. PLANS Jacob reported he is still awaiting comments on the draft plans for Articles 110 and 505. The ARHWG is tentatively scheduled to meet after the January TRIG meeting to review comments. Jacob will confirm or re- schedule this meeting depending on when he receives comments on the draft Article 505 plan. BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT Aquatic Resources Implementation Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150-033, 027 Final 12/08/09 Notes, Page 2 of 3 FISH PASSAGE TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP Nick reported that the design consultant has been selected for the Lower Baker FSC. PSE has given them limited permission to proceed while working to complete the contract. The kick-off with the consultant occurred December 7. The contract should be complete in early January. The next meeting of the FPTWG is likely to take place in February or March of 2010. ARTICLE 107(c) TEAMLET REPORT Mark Killgore reported that it has been a busy autumn for the PSE Hydrology Group as they address issues around water regulation and management. Next steps will include additional analysis using some current models that have been used for relicense processes including various hydrologic scenarios and flood analysis. With that information they will be better positioned to move ahead. There is a broader modeling effort in licensing support underway which may partially tie into this effort. He will continue to keep us posted.
