Our next face-to-face meeting is currently anticipated to be on October 27 at a location to be determined. Last year at the fall face to face meeting, we conducted a brief business meeting followed by a walk through the license. We would like to know if you think a repeat would be useful for this year. In the mean time we will continue to reserve the 4th Wednesday each month for a conference call or face to face meeting as needed. Thanks again for your enthusiastic and dedicated participation, Cary BRCC update for July 2010 Aquatic Resource Group (ARG) The ARG met via a conference call and web broadcast on July 13th. PSE provided the latest updates on the Hatchery and Adult Fish Trap projects which were put into operation in time for receiving the sockeye returns. Since the ARG meeting, the project has experienced very high numbers of returning sockeye salmon. Through July 28, nearly 16,000 sockeye have been transported (the 2nd highest on record). Several notable achievements have also been observed. The highest single day collection on record of nearly 2,000 were transported, the return tripled pre-season forecast and doubled escapement levels prompting both tribal and recreational fisheries into action in the Baker River downstream, and a first ever Baker Lake recreational fishery for salmon is underway. The fish co-managers provided a plan for distribution of sockeye to the hatchery and to Baker Lake. The hatchery is currently well on it's way to fulfilling it's goal for 3,800 spawners (which could yield about 5 million eggs), while fish are released into Baker Lake for natural spawning and a surplus available for harvest. PSE is working through punchlist items and construction attention has now turned to the renovation of Spawning Beach #4. News of the robust sockeye return comes on the heels of a historical season for the Upper Baker FSC operation. Over 1/2 million juvenile fish (433,000 sockeye and 80,000 coho) were collected and transported downstream. The season is winding down and the downstream passage facilities will likely operate till the end of the July. After the general fish facilities operations updates were provided to the ARG, Mark Killgore and Jay Smith (with TetraTech) presented an update on the SA 107(c) developments. Jay Smith reviewed the objectives; the tools and data; and summarized the work completed to date for the imminent flood drawdown study and described some next steps. Tetra Tech will work with PSE to file:///C|/.../LOCALS~1/Temp/A9R2897.tmp/Baker%20River%20Coordinating%20Committee%20Report%20for%20July%202010%20.htm[1/6/2011 10:19:30 AM] develop tools for feasibility evaluation and consult with the ARG on testing potential protocols. The draft presentation was sent out to the ARG members along with the draft meeting notes. The Article 110 shoreline erosion draft article report is out for 30- day review to the ARG with comments due by July 30th. The next ARG meeting will be on August 10th at PSE's Snoqualmie Operations Center. t is anticipated that the Article 505 Aquatic Riparian Habitat Working Group will meet in person at the conclusion of this ARG meeting. For the remainder of 2010, ARG in-person meetings and conference calls are planned to alternate each month. Terrestrial Resources Implementation Group (TRIG) The next scheduled TRIG meeting will be on August 5th from 9 A.M. until 1 P.M., split between two locations (the PSE Skagit Service Center in Burlington, and the Snoqualmie Conference Center in Snoqualmie Ridge) with video conferencing and WebEx call in. The TRIG met on July 1st in Burlington. A decision was queued up to the TRIG group with the proposal for having the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation (Ray Croswell) and PSE's Real Estate representative (Ira McDaniel) continue to search for potential properties related to Settlement Articles 502, 503, and 504, and bring those potential properties to the TRIG for review, with the expectation that PSE Real Estate and RMEF would work approximately 2 days per month each with the approximate total cost of $3,000 per month (including expenses) charged to the acquisition funds for above articles. The TRIG agreed by consensus. Ray and Ira are actively looking for properties and will have a presentation at the next TRIG meeting. Martha Bray of the Skagit Land Trust joined the group to present information about a potential property. Work on the Alder Creek implementation document review is ongoing, and TRIG members will be bring their comments and edits to the next TRIG meeting. Jim Davis (NCCC) presented information about the North Cascades Conservation Council’s proposal to designate land from Baker Lake east to the current North Cascades National Park into additional park land. A map of the proposal can be found on the NCCC website: www.americanalps.com. NCCC’s timeline is to formalizer the proposal by fall. There have been several loon surveys in the last two months. On June 10, two loons were sighted (1 at UB, 1 at LB), neither near a platform. On June 28, there were 12 observations, none close to a platform, all adults, at least one pair. There were two more surveys in July (July 13 and 28) and results will be presented at the next TRIG meeting. Haley sent out the Night Roost Survey Annual Report on June 30th, kicking off the 30-day review period. Another round of night roost surveys starts this November. There have been 13 osprey nest tree development sites identified, and the sites are currently being evaluated. Scott Heller reported that he has been working on the implementation documents for Plants of Special Status and Carex flava as well as the annual report for noxious weeds. GPS mapping of Reed canarygrass in wetlands WB-17 and WB-30 is underway, and he will bring that information to a future TRIG meeting. Sound Native Plants was hired to grow the plants for re-vegetation after Reed canarygrass management and they will collect seed this summer, so that process has begun. The Botanical Teamlet will likely meet again in September. Recreation Resources Group (RRG) Next scheduled RRG meeting is Tuesday, August 17, 2010, at Skagit Service Center Recreation Article Draft Annual Reports will go out for agency review on Friday, July 30. Preliminary Draft water safety tear-sheet maps will be reviewed at August 17 meeting. Preliminary Draft screening (aesthetics) plan for Upper Baker screening will be reviewed at August 17 meeting. Very preliminary swimming delineation schematic will be available for discussion at August 17 meeting. Cultural Resources Advisory Group (CRAG) The CRAG did not meet in July to give members time to review the final draft HPMP distributed on July 2nd, 2010. Comments for the final draft are due to PSE no later than August 2, 2010. The next CRAG meeting is scheduled for August 18, 2010 in Burlington at the PSE Skagit Service Center.
