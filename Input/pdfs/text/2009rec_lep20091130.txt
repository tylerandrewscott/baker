Funding Sources Pam explained that PSE has been paying for extra enforcement on holidays and opening fishing day. They have funded extra coverage with Whatcom County. She expects this practice to continue. This is not funded with relicensing monies.  As part of License Article 318 on law enforcement there is $22K in funding that we can decide how to spend once the Law Enforcement Plan is complete. These funds roll over to the next year if not spent. Since we are in the second year of license issuance, that amount has grown to $44K. There is also $73K  Baker River Project Relicense RRG LEP Teamlet Final Meeting Notes November 30, 2009 Page 1 of 5  FERC Project NO. 2150   designated for the USFS.  Some funding may also be available from funding designated for the Cultural and Recreation Groups. We can petition for some of these funds without having completed the Law Enforcement Plan. Decisions on whether to grant petitions will be made by the working groups. This teamlet is a subset of the Recreation Working Group.  CURRENT COVERAGES PSE funds extra coverage from Whatcom County for Opening Day Fishing and holidays. USFS Repeater Station trial Summer 2010 <ad> to increase communications coverage North end. MOAs with USFS and WDFW, DNR repeaters. WDFW can monitor Whatcom County and Skagit County frequencies. Jeremy is off duty Tuesday / Wednesday or Wednesday / Thursday. Jeff is off duty Sunday / Monday or Monday / Tuesday. Friday / Saturday they work pm shift. Try to both be available Friday / Saturday nights. USFS hires seasonals (Forest Protection Officers) <ad> can write some tickets (fees / resource damage), but do not have law enforcement commissions. Only water coverage (lake enforcement) is Jeff (no one else is boat certified to work with him) Jeff was out on the water 3 times last summer <ad> Whatcom County boat is old and is a liability. WDFW law enforcement officers were out on water twice. Most education is delivered verbally. WDFW has 2 officers upriver <ad> unscheduled. Informal communications among LEOs <ad> cell, email. Whatcom County put up new cell tower on Glover Mountain. WDFW, starting in 2009, has one (1) LEO for coverage for three counties for holidays.

Coordination of the semi annual meetings (Feb/March timeframe and also November) a. We would review and revise the plan applying lessons learned from the previous season 2. Training 3. Implementation / Operations Plan By our next meeting in February of 2010, Sergio explained that we will review a template that identifies the key decisions / details of implementation plans for discussion. Our discussions from this meeting will inform the template that we develop for the outline. In the handout of the revised management plan Sergio pointed out that Appendix 1 captures the various stakeholder interests that we identified at our last meeting on October 20, 2009. He walked us through the revised outline. Our aim is to be clear about the next steps at our next meeting in February. We focused on Section 6 <ad> roles and responsibilities at the project. We also discussed the processes PSE will use to help law enforcement at the project. The aim of the management plans is to capture a higher level view of what PSE will do for law enforcement. Brock (WDFW) mentioned that we should list details gathered and offered during the meetings that we would include in a plan, to an ongoing list. Before we finalize a draft management plan, the Law Enforcement Plan/ Recreational Resource Groups should revisit the list and determine which details the group should added to the management plan and which detail the group should add to the specific implementation plan. An ongoing list would record group members' ideas and thoughts and  Baker River Project Relicense RRG LEP Teamlet Final Meeting Notes, November 30, 2009  FERC Project No. 2150 Page 3 of 5   make the creation of both plans more collaborative as PSE could incorporate these ideas in the management plan's final draft or the preliminary outline for the implementation plan. Some of this includes the funding and annual activities. In creating procedures to support law enforcement, we discussed communication, resource protection patrols, and response protocols. Our semi annual meetings will help facilitate this. We need to ensure the attendance (in person or by phone) of agency folks who have responsibilities relative to law enforcement and resource protection to discuss a number of relevant items. Topics would include who has what coverage, protocols for sharing of information etc. Other ideas include periodic training sessions that different agency staff could take part in. Training might include cultural, terrestrial resource protections, etc. OPERATIONAL / IMPLEMENTATION PLAN We discussed what we would want to include in the more detailed implementation plan. Key elements would include: a recap of what is currently going on and what is being spent and what potentially might come from the license, detail of costs, etc. associated with additional patrols. We would also include priorities for equipment if there are still funds available and the possibility of using a grant or cost sharing with other entities. Jon reminded us that it will be important to tie the actions listed in the plan to the goals of the license article. Note: Mark pointed out that there may be key info that we want to keep out of the plans such as shifts officers are working, etc. For the implementation plan we may want to protect some info as a CEII (Critical Energy Infrastructure Information) document. Section 6: Roles We brainstormed the following general roles of the various stakeholders: USFS Roles: Resource protection (vegetation, fish and wildlife, habitat, etc) Law enforcement <ad> a number of authorized uses - administrative function Providing for public safety on National Forest lands (roads, trails) Law enforcement <ad> public and employee safety; protection of resource and property WDFW: Preserve, protect, perpetuate F&W in Washington State Resolve human and wildlife conflicts Provide for public safety Provide for recreational opportunities to extent possible (while doing the above) Enforce Title 77 (F&W code).
