Pam will set up next meting in October (after RRG meeting on October 20?) and send out invitation to attend. LAW ENFORCEMENT PLAN BACKGROUND Cary Feldmann (PSE) explained that the Baker Project license was issued in 1956. It expired in 2006. During the relicense process PSE pulled together stakeholders representing aquatic, terrestrial, recreational, operational, and cultural / historical interests. They met monthly for six years and crafted a Settlement Agreement that all signed. Within the 18 Recreation-related articles, Article 318 was drafted for law enforcement in the Baker Basin. The Federal Energy regulatory Commission (FERC) doesn't feel like it is their jurisdiction to deal with law enforcement. PSE is planning to invest $360 million over the next 50 years. PSE wants to see that the terms of the license are implemented in effective and efficient ways. They acknowledge that they are not experts in the  Baker River Project Relicense RRG/LEP Final Meeting Notes June 16, 2009  FERC Project NO. 2150 Page 1 of 4   field of law enforcement and therefore they are committed to pulling together the right parties to draft a Law Enforcement Plan appropriate to the Baker Basin. Ann explained that the intent of this article is to take a broad look at law enforcement. How best can we address safety, security, law enforcement, fishing, etc.? In answering this question the intent was also to consider addressing issues such as signage, communications, public information, etc. Review of License Article 318 Lyn walked us though the language in License Article 318 on law enforcement. With this meeting we are complying with the requirement to meet within one year of license issuance (October, 2008). We will also need to have the recreation resource Group (RRG) review the plan we draft at least 30 days ahead of 2 year deadline to complete the plan. Law Enforcement Plan Contents Sergio (EDAW) explained that Law Enforcement Plans typically include the following:  Jurisdictions/roles and responsibilities in Baker Basin Procedures/emergencies Definition of emergency Types of emergencies Triggers Contact trees Coverage issues, etc. Description of Current Operations First responders make decisions based on jurisdictions. Current quick response from Skagit County to Lower Baker, PSE Dam Operators function in quasi law enforcement role at Upper Baker. This is not ideal. If something happens at Upper Baker and Whatcom County id not available, Skagit County responds (through 911). Onsite housing for PSE Dam Operator was removed in 2002/2003. WDFW's primary function revolves around wildlife. They also have broad law enforcement authority (like State Patrol). Tribal law enforcement applies only to tribal lands. Whatcom / Skagit County may decide not to send someone to answer a call for help (this depends on the level of criticality) e.g., a speeding vehicle. Whatcom County has air capability for high-level surveillance only. Both counties have jurisdiction that extends to the lakes. What's Going Well Currently PSE's funding for OT for Whatcom County officers at campgrounds during holiday weekends and opening day of fishing If a citizen dials 911 for help, eventually someone will respond For medical emergencies ambulances respond quickly (to Upper Baker) Limiting "squatters" at campgrounds  Baker River Project Relicense RRG/LEP Final Meeting Notes June 16, 2009  FERC Project No. 2150 Page 2 of 4   Limiting large gatherings at campsites (no more than 2 cars per site)  What isn't Going Well Currently Some 911 calls are not responded to in a timely manner There is no specific / standardized protocol for reporting or logging who responds and when (Note: Suggestion was made for PSE staff to request a callback after response.) PSE doesn't currently have a boat available for emergency purposes Signage may be inadequate There is frequent vandalism at the Lake Shannon Boat Launch  Brainstormed List of Suggestions to Improve Law Enforcement in the Baker Basin Note: Where more than one participant expressed a particular desire, the number is indicated in parentheses at the end of each suggestion.  More security cameras at lake Shannon Boat Launch PSE hires law enforcement dedicated to serving project needs Do more to protect the dams and infrastructure including gate to dam (Article 317) Have plant personnel request a call-back after response occurs WDFW boat to handle on-water issues <ad> river and lakes, including search and rescue (3) Better communication in needed <ad> many dead spots in the Basin. This is also a safety issue. (8) o Handheld satellite phones? o Night goggles? Increased uniform presence would help <ad> more eyes and ears (maybe use Forest Service seasonals) Build a big jail onsite Coordinate with area Emergency Action Plan Need more resources to cover vast territory Need to provide protection to Floating Surface Collector (FSC) Improve signage, education and outreach o Especially for Russian population (they tend to over fish) Restrict more access World peace Educate about Search and rescue capability Upper Skagit Tribe land easement (land formerly known as Presidents Trailer Site - that piece goes to tribe as cultural center with lake access o Will it be Upper Skagit easement property be flagged from Lake side o Post as private from lake side (without referencing tribe) Open communication to Concrete residents re what to expect fro law enforcement Extra funding to allow for Lake Shannon patrolling More OT funding (show the flag) (3) Kiosk for Upper baker area with cameras, etc. One-way traffic across the dam  Handouts June 16 Agenda Draft Article 318: Law Enforcement  Baker River Project Relicense RRG/LEP Final Meeting Notes June 16, 2009  FERC Project No. 2150 Page 3 of 4   Meeting Evaluation Well Done:  Great attendance People were heard and are excited about going forward Good participation Do Differently: Ran late Room was too small Room was too warm  Baker River Project Relicense RRG/LEP Final Meeting Notes June 16, 2009  FERC Project No. 2150 Page 4 of 4    2009rrg20090616_lep.pdf en
