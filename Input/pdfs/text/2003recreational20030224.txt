REPORT ON OLD ACTION ITEMS <b7> Chris: Buttoned up with Ann, Andy, and Jim regarding R12 "observation" part of report. Chris put together an annotated outline for the report and is waiting for feedback. <b7> Andy: Distributed a CD of all the pictures he has taken for the R5 study plan. The CD also contains an Excel Index and a pdf file listing locations. The pdf file map is incomplete <ad> missing the locations Baker River Project Relicense February 24, 2003 Page 2 of 5 FERC Project NO. 2150 Recreation Resources Working Group   of the last few shots. PME DISCUSSION Teamlet Report: Andy reported that the teamlet met February 4 and discussed safety and roads. They kept discussions to a high level. At that meeting, Chris shared maps for R11 and R15. LAND USE INFORMATION STATUS Chris distributed a summary of current land use information. Chris feels like we have basically collected most of the land use information required by FERC. Much of this information was published in the Initial Information Packet and the Initial Consultation Document. On the "Land Use/Management Study Status" document, Lauri requested the third bullet on the second section, page one, be stricken. This statement has no relevance to the material being presented. Current land use information is a critical step in guessing what future land use patterns might be. There was discussion around the scope of the land use survey. Ann suggested that there were GIS layers not reflected in the merged land allocations (scenic corridors, ROS and VQO). These are from the 1990 Forest Plan and are still in effect. We will review the land use and zoning maps at the workshop and note additional needs. PME REVIEW: 220 <ad> AESTHETICS Andy distributed the latest version of this draft PME for review. Much of this will depend on the aesthetics study that is still underway (R-5). 230 <ad> ROADS/ACCESS Andy distributed the latest version of this draft PME for review. Comments were integrated into this version since the teamlet meeting February 4. Public access to Lake Shannon is a priority with this group. Next Steps: Integrate information from the studies (R9 and R13) and figure out what our definition of "project related roads" will be. We also need to review road-to-trail conversion potential. We have various categories of impact that applies (direct, indirect, etc.). Types of road use include: <b7> Administrative <b7> Recreational <ad> campground, launch ramps, trail heads <b7> Scenic drives ( subset of dispersed use) <b7> Access to and from developed facilities on the reservoir <b7> Access to non-project related areas in the Basin. Lauri will share the information the Terrestrial Working comes up with re: road use in the basin (for elk study). We need to determine what roads are valuable from a recreational standpoint. Ann mentioned that in the Watershed Analysis, some roads are slated for closure/change in a maintenance level. Baker River Project Relicense February 24, 2003 Page 3 of 5 FERC Project NO. 2150 Recreation Resources Working Group   We'll look at the information we've got to see if it is sufficient. If it isn't, we may want to do a study. R9 Electronic Monitoring Chris reported that this draft study report should be out by end of February (March 7 at the latest). This report will include daily tallies, days of the week and vehicle classifications. R12 Site Inventory Working Group members should provide feedback to Chris by March 7 on the outline/content of this study report. The timing of the report will depend on the amount of narrative put in this report. The report could be out as early as the third week of March. R13 VISITOR SURVEY Chris got the 3rd stage results from Hebert on February 7. They did some general data clean up. They also provided some additional information as requested by this group. This report should be out for review by Working Group members by mid March (if not sooner). Manual traffic counts from this study were included in the R9 report. The observation records-occupancy rates for dispersed sites will be included in the R12 report. This should be out by mid March. Additional information will be out by late March. R14 SECONDARY DATA Continuing- nothing new to report. R11/15 CAPACITY/SUITABILTIY ANALYSIS Alex showed us the new maps that R-2 put together, including the initial constraint layers reviewed by the February 4th teamlet. The IAC appreciates the responsiveness to this study request. The draft interim study report is due out late March. In the meantime, R-2 will be putting the trail link identifiers on the composite maps and preparing the matrix of constraints for the potential development nodes. They will also add constructed facilities, wetlands, bald eagle nests and development nodes for the Lake Shannon boat ramp. The issue was also raised if these maps are distributed to the public, what types of sensitive information can be displayed? Lauri will check with the Wildlife and Terrestrial Working Group on sensitive wildlife information. R16 NEEDS ANALYSIS Draft report material is waiting for review. We will need to integrate the updated information from R13. Chris guesses this will be out for review by the end of March (without the Visioning exercise write-up) We need to see that underserved and un-served needs have been considered. March Workshop: Prior to the Workshop A CD listing all the PMEs that each research Working Group is considering along with a draft agenda for the March Workshop was out on February 19th. Baker River Project Relicense February 24, 2003 Page 4 of 5 FERC Project NO. 2150 Recreation Resources Working Group   Participants will be asked to fill out a pre-workshop worksheet to consider how to resolve conflicts, etc. PSE will send out their proposal (with elements of Working Group PMEs) for review on Feb. 26. This proposal is a subset of the PMES brainstormed in the Working Groups and takes into account the interests of stakeholders in the process. Lauri will share the information the Terrestrial Working Group comes up re: road use in the basin (for elk study). Ann mentioned that in the Watershed Analysis, some roads are slated for closure/change in maintenance level. We'll look at the information we've got and see if it is sufficient. If it isn't we may want to do a study. CROSS RESOURCE WORKSHOP March 4, Tuesday (afternoon only) 1:00-5:00 High level PMEs presentations by a member of each Working Group (Cultural, Terrestrial, Aquatics, Recreation, Economics/Operations) Chris has graciously accepted our request that he do our presentation. Probable Attendees: Andy, Brian and Chris March 5, Wednesday (all day) Dee will begin with a review of the background of our process to date. She will then do a brief training session on interest-based negotiations to kick things off. Then we will walk through PSE's Proposal, highlighting pieces that have cross-resource implications e.g., the proposed reservoir management regime. Joel Molander of PSE will explain how PSE came up with its reservoir management plan (share outputs from HYDROPs model runs, etc.) Then we will split up into small cross-resource groups to: Flag impacts on resource (add conflicts to lists already posted from Feb. Working Group meeting) List how it affects the organizational interests Report back to the larger group Probable Attendees: Andy, Chris, Lauri, Brian, Susan(?), Jim March 6, Thursday (all day) Finish PSE Proposal (pieces with cross resource implications) Review other PMEs with cross resource implications Review (amended) list of conflicts Brainstorm to resolve conflicts Review (amended) list of conflicts Brainstorm to optimize synergies Plan next steps Probable Attendees: Andy, Chris, Brian, Jim, Lauri (half day) HANDOUTS (handouts to be posted on the web will be bolded) Baker River Project Relicense February 24, 2003 Page 5 of 5 FERC Project NO. 2150 Recreation Resources Working Group   <b7> Land Use/Management Study Status 2/24/03 <b7> Protection, Mitigation, and Enhancement Measures submitted to Baker River Hydroelectric Project No. 2150 (Reference No. 220) Project Title: Develop and Implement an Aesthetics Management Plan <b7> Protection, Mitigation and Enhancement Measures submitted by the Participant for Baker River Hydroelectric Project No. 2150 (Reference 230) Project Title: Provide and Maintain Public Access <b7> Cross Resource Workshop, Baker River Hydroelectric Project No. 2150 <ad> Key Conflicts, Key Synergies and Shared Interests/Concerns <b7> Studies Update 2/24/03 <ad> R9 Electronic Monitoring' R12 Site Inventory; R13 Visitor Survey; R14 Secondary Date; R11/15 Capacity/Suitability Analysis (including trails); R16 Needs Analysis <b7> Preliminary Work Product, Study R15, Recreational Trail Analysis- Description of Proposed Trail Route Segments, Lake Shannon PARKING LOT <b7> Presentation of National Forest Plan <b7> Land management <b7> Forest Service presentation of SMS <b7> Hold periodic "outreach" meetings for feedback from other groups (hiking, horseback riding, etc.) <b7> Field trip- summer 2003? <b7> Review USFS Roads Analysis Report- 2003? <b7> Tie education piece to ALL Working GROUPS <b7> Access Management Study EVALUATION OF MEETING Things Done Well <b7> Got study results reviewed <b7> Making good progress <b7> Starbucks coffee! <b7> Glad to have Lyn back <b7> Nice maps Do Differently Next Time <b7> Missed Susan <b7> Brian refusing to be our presenter!
