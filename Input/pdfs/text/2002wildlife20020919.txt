Ron has reviewed the study request and sent his Statement of Qualifications to Tony to share with team members. He will want to meet with the elk teamlet on Sept. 24 to put together a proposal for going forward with the study.  PME MATRIX UPDATE Dee distributed copies of the updated matrix of potential options for PMEs. We then began walking through the list and noting which options should fall out due to legal or technical feasibility reasons. We also noted any options that did not pertain to PME needs and those that violated interests represented at the table and where there was strong support. We also agreed to accept the assumptions set by the Aquatics Working Group as a basis for our discussion with one exception. There was some resistance to honoring the assumption around flood control. We finally agreed to accept the list of assumptions by rewording number 2 as shown below:  BASELINE ASSUMPTIONS: 1. Project remains in place. 2. Flood control will be required. 3. Legal requirements have to be addressed.  Dee will integrate these edits into the matrix and send it out for our review by October 3. We will meet again (the entire working group) in Mountlake Terrace on October 10th to finish reviewing this list. By Oct. 8, members will send their list of PMEs with which they have concerns to Tony (along with their Top 5 in terms of priority of interest). We also tentatively set Nov. 8 and Dec. 5 as separate meeting dates (to be held in Lacey at Sawyer Hall) to work specifically on PME development.  SOLUTION TEAM UPDATE The Solution Team has delayed their October meeting to October 30 to give Working Groups as much time as possible to come up with their draft PMEs. Steve Hocking will be this Working Group's representative from FERC since he is a terrestrial biologist. He may attend our October 24 meeting (low probability). He will also attend an ESA meeting on the 29th and a meeting to discuss 401 Water Quality Certification and Coastal Zone Management Act on the 31st.  TEAMLET REPORTS / REPORTS ON EXISTING STUDIES  Study # T2  Title Vegetation Mapping in Project Area  Notes/Next Steps The drawdown database has been completed and drawdown cover type classifications will be finalized this week. Erin Colclazier has returned and will be completing the  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 9/19/2002 MEETING NOTES Lyn Wiltse for Terrestrial Technical Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 3 of 5   Vegetation Mapping project starting Monday. She will be  working on the missing information for the cover typing,  correction of any errors of the maps and completing the draft  final report.  T4 Analysis Species Assessment Two species have been sent out for review. We will be  sending out each species as they are completed. There are no  bird accounts for the Peregrine falcon and the Golden Eagle.  Therefore, Tom suggests we do a complete literature search  for Golden eagle. For Peregrine falcon, Tom suggests we  use the WDFW Status Review to use as the background  information for biology and habitat. All were asked to  review analysis species list for completeness and content  then give Tom feedback as soon as possible. We added  Harlequin duck to the list under riparian habitat. The group  liked the format and level of detail provided for the Loon.  Hamer will use this as a template for other species. This will  be out by the end of September.  T5 Wetland Inventory Study  We agreed to add a field for surveyors to indicate degree of  certainty re: hydrologic connection, in the spreadsheets.  T6 Noxious Weed Assessment and We reviewed the draft study plan and made some revisions  Control Plan  around the general intent and the interpretation stage of the  study. We decided to survey the perimeter above the full  pool mark specifically for knot weed by boat, noting other  obnoxious weeds when found. We will include Maple Grove  campground.  Incorporating these and other edits, the Study Plan was  approved. Tom will send out the revised draft by the end of  September.  T7 Historic Vegetation of the UB Marty walked us through the Historic Vegetation Maps for  and LB Projects  Shannon and Baker that he and Joetta constructed from GLO  notes (1880 and 1892), topographical maps (1915), and  aerial photos (1956, 1959). He explained the assumptions  they made in creating the various layers of these maps. He  also distributed a preliminary study report for this study.  The full report, along with the 8 <bd> x 11 copies of the maps  will be sent out for review on October 11. These maps will  include a single red line to indicate full pool for both Baker  and Shannon. These maps will form the base for future site  potential. The maps will also be available digitally by  request.  T7b Future vegetation mapping  Marty revised the level of detail around the Project  decommissioning scenario. We will have R2 develop a list  of possible variables. We would review this list as a teamlet  and go from there. Stan reminded us that the Solution Team  teamlet that put the Process Document together promised Ed  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 9/19/2002 MEETING NOTES Lyn Wiltse for Terrestrial Technical Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 4 of 5   T-9,10 T11 R-T12 T13 T15 T16 T17 R-T18  Recreation use, effects on Mt.

Studies in Reservoir Fluctuation Zone Breeding Bird Surveys  that the decommissioning scenarios would be kept to a relative high level (to keep scope and costs of study down). This study plan was approved. We need to remember that we will be taking a qualitative look at the data. Marty will get decommissioning scenarios to members for review by the end of October. We have high country use information from the visitor surveys conducted by the Recreation Working Group during the summer of 2001. It includes an estimate of the Baker Lake overnight users that also visit the high country. We will discuss the next steps (mountain goat-related PME?) at our next meeting. The final report has been completed and sent out for review. Give Tom any feedback by October 4, especially re: potential information gaps on the report. Tom will produce a red line/strikeout version. At our October meeting Tom will note any areas of concern we need to discuss. On hold depending on T15 and working group needs. Don was to have a write-up outlining the study need for our review by September 3rd, and we were to discuss at our September 19 meeting. This has been deferred for discussion at the October 24th meeting. Draft Final report has been completed and sent out for review. Some wetlands, riparian zones, and seral stage areas are not included on this map. We look forward to input from Don. We might modify the map to incorporate elk foraging habitat. There may also be HEP implications. We agreed to have another teamlet (floret) meeting to review our list of studies (which has evolved considerably since we began putting this map together) and determine how to proceed re: Phase 2 of the Study Plan. The rare plant database is completed and the draft final report is currently being edited and will be completed by the end of September. Hamer will get preliminary report to Ann for initial review by September 23. The amphibian draft report is almost completed. Joetta Zablotney is working on the maps for the report and will have them to Hamer Environmental in the next week. Hamer will then add the additional information needed into the report. Hope to have preliminary study reports out for our review by end of September. We hope to have the preliminary study report out for review by the end of September. On hold.  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 9/19/2002 MEETING NOTES Lyn Wiltse for Terrestrial Technical Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 5 of 5   R-T19 R-T20 RT21 T22  Habitat Evaluation Studies Wildlife Use in the Reservoir Drawdown Zone Elk studies Fluctuation Zone Enhancement  Teamlet meeting on September 24th. We discussed the possibility of expanding the study and getting information on use vs. availability of cover types in drawdown zone and potential Project effects. This could guide our mitigation/enhancement efforts, especially around analysis species. We decided to go ahead (approve) with the revised study request as it was written (limited scope), and have Tony develop the study plan. A teamlet met to discuss this. Tony distributed a revised Study Request for our review. We agreed to approve this request and move it forward to Study Plan development. Tony will ask Ron Tressler to flesh out the Study Plan. The Elk Teamlet will meet with Ron on September 24th to work on next steps. Gene distributed a study request for our review. This could include a phased approach, possibly evolving into a PME or a management plan. Concern was expressed about introducing any non-native species. Monitoring would have to be rigorous. We approved this request to go forward as a study plan. Gene, Marty and Tony will flesh out the study plan to describe the initial phase.  NEW STUDY REQUESTS None at this meeting.  REVIEW/AMEND NORMS AND PARKING LOT Lyn distributed an updated version of the norms. The new norm of " Be kind and respectful when speaking with each other." We will continue to review the norms periodically to be sure they meet the needs of the group.
