The next meeting of this technical working group will be December 12th.  SOLUTION TEAM MEETING DEBRIEF The Solution Team met for the first time on October 25 at the Forest Service Office in Mountlake Terrace from 9:00 to 3:00. They were missing some key organizations (NMFS, USFWS, Ecology, etc.), but were otherwise well represented. Representatives have been identified from these organizations and full participation is expected at the next meeting, December 13. At the Oct. 25 meeting, members introduced themselves and described their experiences with FERC. They also cited factors contributing to and detracting from success in FERC projects they have been involved with in the past. They drafted a mission statement: By April 30, 2004 develop a settlement agreement and associated documents for relicensing of the Baker River Project that (best) meet the interests of the participants. They will finalize the mission statement and define norms at their next meeting. They will also be putting together a template for working groups to use in submitting options for solution to the Solution Team.  ISSUES/INTERESTS There was strong support between the two groups that they be combined into a single Working Group. This will allow them to work more effectively and efficiently.  Members signed up their organizations for the interests they represent. The group also brainstormed additional issues associated with each interest.  Next Steps: A teamlet of Ken, Arnie, and Nick will merge the spreadsheets of interests and issues that they created for the two separate working groups. They will eliminate redundancies and align issues with appropriate interests as they understand them. By approximately Dec. 1, they will email the combined spreadsheet to Karen and Stan so they can incorporate their comments before emailing the spreadsheet to team members (by approximately December 7) so they can review the list prior to the next meeting on December 14.
