INTRODUCTIONS We welcomed Derek Marks who is representing the Upper Skagit Indian Tribe. PDEA STATUS Marc reported that they are on track to release the PDEA, October 1 for review. SETTLEMENT PROCESS -RESOLVE SESSIONS We are re-drafting language of the PMEs. The next RESOLVE session will be September 12. Our aim is to capture the intentions of each PME. License articles will be supplemented by appendices, with supporting detail. Additional RESOLVE meeting dates are: 9/26, 10/16, and 10/27. SOLUTION TEAM REPORT Baker River Project Relicense 2 of 9 Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File:9:11:03; Lyn Wiltse The first Attorney Meeting is set for 10/20. Some Solution Team members will attend to ensure nothing gets lost in the translation. Flood Control: The USACE is working with Skagit County and PSE (though the re-licensing process) on separate studies to determine the economic feasibility of additional flood control. For now, we are using existing flood control levels as a baseline for our studies. FISH PASSAGE TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP REPORT Arnie reported that the group is continuing work on Floating Surface Collector design, guide net/barrier net and net transition structure. They are looking at three Floating Surface Collector alternatives. They are also reviewing the fish passage PME. They found no major issues around fish screening criteria. They are looking at acclimation facilities separately from fish stress relief facilities. TECHNICAL SCENARIO TEAMLET (TST) UPDATE • PSE White Paper is being prepared on 15 ft. flood control operating buffer. • E-room is working well as a distribution mechanism. • 2nd Hydrology CD out by September 12. • USFS Runs: Analysis of recreational effects at Upper Baker; also Run of River • Stan’s Runs: Max/Min instream flows with 100% reliability • PSE’s Runs: Recent Conditions, also Draft Actions for PDEA INSTREAM FLOWS TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP Phil reported that they will be meeting again on September 25th from 9:00 to 3:00 at Mountlake Terrace. They will be sharing results of the hourly analysis at that time. Things are moving along well. HYDROPS can assist us in coming up with a recommended flow regime. We’ll get a more detailed update at our October meeting. STUDY REQUEST SUBMITTALS/STUDY PLAN DEVELOPMENT Study # Title Notes/Next Steps A01a Reservoir Tributary Habitat Surveys Phil walked us through the executive level summary of this report. R2 will be making a couple of hard copies of the full 360 page report. They will, for the most part, be distributing this by CD. Phil offered to,at a future date, lead us through a detailed review of the report. We’ll let him know if we think this is necessary at our October meeting. A01b Reservoir Tributary Biological Surveys See A01a. Are now also including native non- salmonids in the data tracking. There aren’t a lot of data. ACTIVE A01c Reservoir Tributary Delta Surveys See A01a. ACTIVE A02 LB River Habitat Mapping The draft report will be out for review by our November Working Group Meeting. Baker River Project Relicense 3 of 9 Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File:9:11:03; Lyn Wiltse A03 Reservoir Fish Population Not discussed. No action yet. PSE will review Characteristics existing information for the PDEA. A04 LB/Skagit River Flow, Gaging Not discussed. This is being incorporated into A09a hourly flow routing model. ACTIVE A05 Water Quality Sampling Nothing new to report. A06 UB Passage Design Baffle Complete. Modification A07 Lower Baker Forebay Bathymetry Complete. A08 UB Passage System Evaluation Complete. A09A Skagit River Flow and Habitat Nothing new to report. Assessment A09B Salmonid Redd Selection and Nothing new to report. Maintenance in the Middle Skagit in Response to River Fluctuation from Hydropower Peaking A09C Distribution, Timing and Depth of PSE and R2 have initiated the mainstem Skagit Salmonid Redds River spawning surveys. A09D Distribution, Timing of Salmonid Fry Nothing new to report. A10 Baker River Delta Habitat Assessment- Complete. Note: USFWS is concerned with Char impacts to char and indirectly to bald eagles through chum and also to cutthroat. A11 Nutrient Addition Tie to A26. A12 Instream Flows for Bio-diversity Split between R-A21 & R-A09. A13a Water Quality Impacts of Human Uses Not discussed. Removed from list of studies this of the Reservoir and Adjacent Shorelines. group will address, reported by Brady in September. Greta reported the USFS will pursue this in the recreation working group. A13b Water Quality Impacts on Aquatic Removed from list of studies we will address. Habitat A14a Reservoir Shoreline Erosion We are moving toward a final draft on this report. This will be addressed through the RESOLVE process. A15 UB Delta Scour Phil distributed a handout outlining the proposed expanded survey schedule (who, what, when, where, etc.). R2 has assumed that PSE folks will conduct their standard reservoir shoreline surveys and other parties will have little involvement in the survey effort. A16 Lower Baker River Alluvial Fan Mike Ramey of R2 walked us through a Power Assessment Point Presentation on the results of the first phase of this study. Summary of Alternative 1: Spawning Gravel: • 35,000 yards of fill would need to be placed. • Velocities and depths acceptable over wide range of flows. Baker River Project Relicense 4 of 9 Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File:9:11:03; Lyn Wiltse • High flood flows in Baker with moderate flows in Skagit will scour gravels. • Reduced barrier height at fish facilities (2-3 feet reduction). • Flood levels will rise in lower Baker – maximum increase with 135,000 cfs in Skagit and 28,000 cfs in Baker – 0.5 feet rise. • Analysis based on very limited field data. Summary of Alternative 2: Large Woody Debris and Rock Structures: • Total length of channel approximately 2500 feet. • Assume 1 LWD structure and 1 Rock Structure per 100 feet of channel. • 25 anchored LWD structures within reach. • 25 rock structures within reach. Summary of Alternative 3: Series of Weirs • Due to backwater from the Skagit River, lower weirs would be submerged at moderate Skagit River flows. • Concept would not achieve goal. • Concept eliminated as not technically feasible. Summary of Alternative 4A: Reconfigured Channel • 30,000 yd (3) of cut and fill Summary of Alternative 4B: Reconfigured Low- Flow Channel • Riffle and Pool sequences at low flow • Requires channel filling consistent with Alternative 1. Summary of Alternative 5: Backwater Slough • 50 feet wide x 150 feet long and 6 feet deep excavation (1500 yds). At Skagit River Flow of 4,000 cfs – 25 feet wide x 150 feet long and 3 feet deep slough. At the 7/28 teamlet meeting, it was decided to proceed to Phase 2 with the following Alternatives: 2, 4B (with some LWD, rocks), and 5. Mike explained that conducting the second phase analysis of alternatives 2 and 5 would be pretty easy. 4b would require significant additional level of effort. Baker River Project Relicense 5 of 9 Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File:9:11:03; Lyn Wiltse R2 will undertake the Phase 2 analysis for these three alternatives. We will get a status report from them at our November meeting. This analysis will include impacts to: the barrier dam, construction costs, flood control, fish passage and power production. It will also include habitat values lost in the Lower Baker channel. We will keep in mind the Little Baker restoration process. We don’t want to duplicate efforts. A17 Tributaries Surveys Upstream of Steps 1 through 7 (from 3/11/03 outline document) Barriers to be completed by November ARWG meeting. A18 Baker River Survey Upstream of 1 km. Merged into A01a and A01b. A19 Review Limnological Information This study has been combined with A26a. A20 Large Woody Debris Management The final draft report was distributed.. A21 Skagit Wild & Scenic River Values This is being addressed by A9 and A24. A22 Baker Lake Trout Impacts Evaluation Cancelled when non-native trout stocking in the reservoirs was discontinued.

(The Forest Service indicated they will be providing belated comments to part 1 to Arnie to be appended to the Final Draft.) A draft addendum to Part 1 (reporting IHA statistics for selected period of record for Baker and Skagit gages using updated hydrology) will be transmitted by the August meeting. Comments on Part 2 were due July 15. The schedule for revising Part 2 depends on scope of the comments. A25 Unnatural Predation Not discussed at this meeting. Arnie provided updated effort and catch data (see handouts). Field studies are continuing until the end of July/early August (depending on the out migration). Efforts are already complete at fry releases and are ongoing at smolt releases. Stay tuned… A26A Reservoir Limnology-Production Not discussed at this meeting.The comment period Potential for this study report ended August 14.
