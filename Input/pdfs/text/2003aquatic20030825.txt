Notes from RESOLVE Meetings To permit the greatest degree of open dialogue, the group agreed that notes for the RESOLVE sessions will be less formal than regular working group meetings. We will primarily document agreements and action items. RESOLVE Ground rules • Work at understanding one another. • Use airtime wisely. • Speak honestly and respectfully. • Examine assumptions. Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Aquatics Resources Working Group-RESOLVE session Page 2 of 5 • Make tentative agreements, then look at the whole package together. • One meeting review rule: we have one meeting to review and change the tentative agreements of the previous RESOLVE session.1 • Document our agreements. • Caucuses are okay. Discussion regarding Technical Report Comments Agreement If you have something to add to a draft final report after it’s been printed, send it to Arnie and he will attach it as an appendix to the report on the web site and will e-mail it out to the working group. Review of PME’s Discussed To Date 3.2.1 Upstream Fish Passage: Agreements • Under the 3rd bullet on page 48 of the 8/12/03 PME draft, in the last sentence, “…to meet agreed performance standards.” • Still need to finalize performance standards. This is being handled by the Fish Passage Technical Working Group. Add a bullet to the PME that specifies performance standards. • Overall, tentative agreement on this PME. 3.4.2 Large Woody Debris: Agreements • Add to 4) a: Add something about 30-60 cm diameter category of wood. • Add that the numbers of wood pieces may be modified up or down based on monitoring. • Other than the specifics regarding 30-60 cm diameter wood, the group is in tentative agreement on this PME. 3.1.2 Propagation At the 8/12/03 meeting, all present had set forth their interests with respect to fish propagation. Since Dick Raisler joined the group at this meeting, we added the following interest from the fly fishers: Fly Fishers Interest: Limit the number of hatchery steelheads. Protect and enhance the wild steelhead in the Skagit/Sauk River and, if possible, re-establish a genetically suitable steelhead run to the Baker River. Dick also distributed a letter listing the concerns of the Federation of Fly Fishers. Agreements 1 All agreements are tentative even after the “one meeting review rule”. However, the one meeting rule gives regular participants an opportunity to bring an agreement back to the table while assuring that tentative agreements are not forever reopened. It also accommodates regular participants who must miss a meeting and may want to weigh in on a decision. Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Aquatics Resources Working Group-RESOLVE session Page 3 of 5 • Operation of Beach 4 (under “Description of Actions”, page 42)—add language regarding sediment control at Beach 4 intake. • Re decommissioning of Beaches 2 and 3 (page 44), change to “Retention of Spawning Beaches 2 and/or 3 is preferred by the parties…” • Overall, tentative agreement on Description of Actions up to Supplementation section. • With respect to this section, Steve Fransen will write a white paper to help the group discuss Supplementation. 3.4.1 Fluvial Geomorphic Management Issue: How to maintain flexibility to respond to needs for sediment over time? Possible Agreements (to be further discussed with a clean draft of this PME) • Keep the Baker River action included in this PME. • Leave a reference to our concern about the Skagit and note a cross reference to the HERC Fund. • Put a line item about the Skagit Fluvial Management in the HERC Fund PME. • Keep monitoring in this PME.
