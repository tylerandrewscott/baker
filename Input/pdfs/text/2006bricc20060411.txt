This will trigger the 45-day review period. Comments must be filed with FERC by May 30, 2006. • A 10j meeting also will be scheduled, possibly near the days of the public meetings. BRICC MEETING Participants agreed on a BRICC meeting date of April 24, 2006, from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., at the USFS office in Mountlake Terrace, to discuss the DEIS and prepare for the public meetings. Additional meetings may be scheduled after the public meetings, either for the full BRICC or for specific parties related to specific issues in the DEIS (for example, a meeting with the USFS to discuss the elements of the recreation articles that differ from what was included in the Settlement Agreement). DEIS REVIEW MATRIX Rob Mohn of Louis Berger is completing a matrix to help facilitate the DEIS review and comment process. The matrix will focus on measures in the Settlement Agreement and how they were treated by FERC. The matrix will also attempt to explain FERC’s rationale for any deviations from the Settlement Agreement. Connie will send the matrix to the BRICC members by the end of this week. COMMENTS ON DEIS/PROCESS Participants who have reviewed the DEIS so far noted that there were few changes in the aquatics measures from the Settlement Agreement. The major changes were in the terrestrial and recreation measures. One major measure that FERC eliminated was Article 505, Aquatic Riparian Habitat Protection, Restoration and Enhancement Plan. Two reasons FERC noted for changing or eliminating measures from what was in the Settlement Agreement included: 1) not enough information and 2) no nexus to the Project. Cary gave a brief summary of each of the measures and how FERC treated them in the DEIS. He noted that FERC removed all mention of PSE providing funding to third parties, such as the Forest Service, and recommended PSE implement the actions noted. He noted that the two most substantial measures that FERC eliminated included Article 505 and Article 602, which provided for funds for future actions. Rob noted that the FERC staff summarized and rewrote every measure from the Settlement Agreement, to BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 4/11/2006 NOTES BRICC Conference Call FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 2   basically catch the essence of the measure. He noted that a key question to ask is whether if a key sentence or idea is missing from the FERC text, is that because the information has been summarized or because FERC has deliberately left out some elements of the measure. He said FERC may use their summary as the meat of the article and expect details to show up in the plans that are required. Chuck noted that his understanding is that FERC attempted to keep the goal of each measure the same even if they used different wording. He said FERC generally called out any significant changes from the Settlement Agreement. LouEllyn noted that FERC deleted some key information in the Lewis River Project’s license articles but that the FERC public meeting allowed an opportunity to discuss this missing information. FERC did “reinstate” some elements in the Lewis River license by compromise with the parties. She also noted that the FERC meeting was valuable and was run more like a discussion than a formal comment meeting. Rod noted that he will be meeting with Walt Dortch this week and will ask how the Forest Service responded to the Lewis River license articles. This information may help us with comments on the Baker DEIS. Cary noted that PSE is as committed to the Settlement Agreement now as when it was signed. Because FERC’s changes amount to approximately $30+ million less (50-year license) than what was included in the Settlement Agreement, PSE must still be able to make the case to the WUTC especially if the measures go forward. Cary noted that some of the elements eliminated by FERC might fit into side agreements with parties or some may be restored through the Forest Service’s 4(e) process. He reminded us that we must all continue to work together to see the settlement through.
