Mind the logistics involved in surveying other people’s properties, etc. • Tony: Email Carl the HYDROPS output memos from Powel • Laura: Button up with Carl, Tony (and Bob C?) on how to reword the Noxious Weed PME to reflect today’s discussions by the end of the year. • Lauri: Update draft of Wildlife Management Plan to reflect recent PME discussions (PME Table, etc.) • Marty: Update and distribute PME table to reflect today’s discussions and send out for all to review. • Marty: Work with Don and Lauri re: which PMEs have implementation costs already covered and send list around for all to review. • Gene: Set up conference call line for Dec. 11 conference call (9:30 to 11:30) and send dialing instructions out to BAWG members. Send out agenda of unresolved issues to guide the discussion including but not limited to the following: • Is it necessary to include MAP stations in PMEs? • What should 1.5.1 Discretionary Fund look like? • What should 1.6.3 Monitoring Fund look like? • What should 6.6 TERF Fund be? • 3.3.4 Bald Eagle integration with aquatics? • 1.3.3 Legacy Wood User reality check • 1.2.1: Don’s new cost estimate for Elk forage Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Terrestrial Resources Working Group RESOLVE Session, December 05, 2003 Page 2 of 6 • Others? • BAWG: Participate in Dec. 11 conference call. Report on Completed Action Items • Tony: Distributed hard copies of HYDROPS run re: evaluating the effect of the Draft Action reservoir management on Recent Conditions in Energy Year 1995. The March, April, and half of May numbers reflect reservoir operations to benefit amphibian breeding in drawdown zones. • Laura: Yes, coconuts are indeed nuts! • Bob C. and Len: Reserved a beautiful conference room for us at TNC Seattle Office for Nov. 18 BAWG meeting and Dec. 5 and 11 RESOLVE meetings. Thanks! • Don: Helped flesh out priority of “grizzly spots” (BMUs). • Marty: By 11/5, updated the PME Summery Table and distributed it for members to review: • Lyn: Checked with Dee and found she was available to facilitate the RESOLVE meeting on Dec. 11. (Team leader note: This meeting has been cancelled). • Gene: Set up conference call line for Nov. 18 conference call and send dialing instructions out to BAWG members. • Laura and Carl got together with Tony to discuss Noxious Weed PME/costs further prior to our Dec. 5 meeting. • Marty looked at fleshing the Breeding Bird PME out in a manner consistent with his other recent analysis. • Lyn: Reserved USFS Office in Mountlake Terrace for 2004. Beginning in February, move to third WEDNESDAY instead of third THURSDAY of each month. (See list on page 1). To permit the greatest degree of open dialogue, the group agreed that notes for the RESOLVE sessions will be less formal than regular working group meetings. We will primarily document agreements and action items. RESOLVE Groundrules and Criteria Following are the original RESOLVE ground rules agreed to by the working group: • Work at understanding one another. • Use airtime wisely. • Speak honestly and respectfully. • Examine assumptions. • Make tentative agreements, then look at the whole package together. • One meeting review rule: we have one meeting to review and change the tentative agreements of the previous RESOLVE session.1 • Document our agreements. 1 All agreements are tentative even after the “one meeting review rule”. However, the one meeting rule gives regular participants an opportunity to bring an agreement back to the table while assuring that tentative agreements are not forever reopened. It also accommodates regular participants who must miss a meeting and may want to weigh in on a decision. The group also agreed that materials to be considered at the RESOLVE session would be sent out in advance, per regular working group rules, if group members were expected to attempt agreement on those materials. Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Terrestrial Resources Working Group RESOLVE Session, December 05, 2003 Page 3 of 6 • Caucuses are okay. • For each PME, we will begin by identifying the goal and measurable objectives • We will use the 5/7/03 PME’s, as updated, for our RESOLVE discussion. • After we have agreed to a PME, Marty will revise it to reflect our agreement. Only after that will draft settlement language be written. Acreage Discussion The BAWG reaction to PME Table put together by Marty and discussed at the last RESOLVE meeting is captured below: 1.1.1 Deciduous Forest Bird Habitat BAWG interest is certainty around what is done and when. They suggested a $1MM cap, based on an assumption that much of this PME's goals will be achieved through the joint aquatic-terrestrial habitat acquisition PME. There was concern about Aquatics folks having control here. Their preference is not to allow for overlap with the other PMEs. 1.2.1 Provide Foraging Habitat for Elk The proposal here assumes $1.25MM as the cost of the Mystery Property. We will revisit this if the cost of the property ends up being much above this. Marty’s original estimate of the total cost was bumped up from $4.7MM to approximately $5.2MM. Don will continue to refine this estimate. 1.2.2 Grizzly Forage We reached conceptual agreement that this will be program management money. We are looking at $100K for implementation and $20K for the planning, for a total of $120K. Marty will revise the PME accordingly. The group issued a collective yelp of WUHOOO in appreciation for Don’s diligent and creative work on this PME! 1.2.4 Wetland Habitat The estimate for the total cost of this PME appears to be acceptable, based on an assumption that much of this PME's goals will be achieved through the joint aquatic-terrestrial habitat acquisition PME. Overlap use of the lands would be the margin between the different interests. 1.2.5 Provide Connectivity Habitat for Low Mobility Species Don proposed dropping this PME and all agreed. 1.3.3 Legacy Wood Users (previously Cavity Dwellers) Marty distributed a new draft of this PME for the group to consider. PSE will spend $50K for the plan and $10K/year plus the cost of the wood to implement. As additional lands are purchased, PSE would update the plan accordingly. Goal is 75% of maximum. We need to consider whether this is the right number. 1.3.4: Bald Eagles – Habitat on Non-Project Lands Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Terrestrial Resources Working Group RESOLVE Session, December 05, 2003 Page 4 of 6 Bob C. and Bob K and Don are working with Stan and Scott on this re: integrating this into their Aquatics PME (3.4.4). There is uncertainty around costs and control. 1.3.6 Bald Eagle Night Roost Survey (was Bald Eagle Monitoring) The monitoring PME would focus on periodic surveys for bald eagle night roosts. The group agreed that $50K is probably sufficient for this PME. 1.4.1 Plants of Special Status Several more S&M plant sites were added to the table (by Laura via e-mail), however, the cost estimate remains unchanged, since many of the sites could be combined within the site plans. 1.4.2 Noxious Weeds Laura handed out a new version of this PME and reported that she, Carl and Tony got together and agreed to cap of $500K for the 7 wetlands portion of the plan over the 30-year license period. We agreed to split out the discussion of weed control on acquired lands. This could mean splitting it out within the PME or removing it completely from the PME and addressing it within the framework of Land Acquisition Management Plan through the BRCC. Next steps: Laura will button up with Carl, Tony and Bob C. on how to reword the PME to reflect today’s discussions. Laura will get the final version of the PME to Marty by the end of the year. 1.4.3: Carex flava There were no changes to this PME other than some small changes to the cost estimate. Laura and Tony have revised the cost estimate to be approximately $408,700. This includes general activities and propagation. 1.?? Breeding Birds PME There was consensus to integrate this PME into 1.1.1. There is still discussion about MAPS stations being needed part of PME 1.6.3 (see BAWG action item above) in light of now having PME 1.1.1. 1.6.1 Wildlife Plan Development We agreed to put $50K as the cost for this. Lauri will update her initial draft to reflect our PME discussions (probably after the first of the year). 6.6 TERF Fund We need to consider this as a way to create certainty for future unforeseen needs. Maybe this would kick in after the first 5 or 10 years? The BAWG will consider an amount they feel is appropriate.
