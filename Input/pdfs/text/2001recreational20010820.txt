Evaluate meeting NEW ACTION ITEMS · ALL: Review Aquatic Studies (for information purposes) · Chris: Secure contact from Whatcom and Skagit Counties · Ann: Get Rockport State Park use data to Chris · Tony/Chris: Discuss what fishing information is needed and how best to gather it with Nick and Arnie and invite them to attend our September or October meeting. · Tony: Check on availability date of the PSE Operational Model. Invite Bob Barnes to do demo. · Tony: Check availability of Mt. Vernon PSE Office for November 19 meeting. · Ann and Ardis: Create study request for Road Access Analysis (travel) · Tony: Create list of all different studies going on in the different Working Groups · Chris: Get GPS data for dispersed sites to R2 so they can add them to the maps. · Chris: Revise draft of R11, creating a study plan (keep R15 separate). Send out for members to review prior to next meeting. · Chris: Route around R2 viewshed data when available. REPORT ON OLD ACTION ITEMS · Ann: Checked with Leif re: snowmobile counters and found his counts were extrapolations on trailhead observation numbers on days they do compliance checks. He uses a beam-breaking counter, which he didn’t find very accurate. · Ann: Distributed a March 19 Study Request on Wild & Scenic River ORVs for the Skagit River. This would include recreation and wildlife. This request is currently in the Aquatic Working Group. · Ann: Reserved the new Forest Service Office at Sedro-Woolley for our 10/22 meeting. · Ann: Reserved the Mountlake Terrace Forest Service Office for our 9/24 and 12/17 meetings. FISHING SURVEYS We are waiting to review data from the 2001 Opening Day Creel Survey. We need to coordinate with the Aquatics Working Group to determine ownership/disposition of the “Baker Lake Trout Evaluation” Study Request submitted by Karen Kloempken/WDFW (Aquatic Group). We may want to review relevant historic creel census data to look for trends. The general consensus of this group is that the more data the better the decision making capability. Our interests extend beyond trout, to include all recreationally– BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT FOR 8/20/01 MEETING NOTES L Wiltse for Recreation Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 2   related fishing. Tony and Chris were assigned an action item to discuss this study request at the next PSE team leader meeting. LAND USE The Recreation Working Group will take the lead on developing baseline land use and NEPA documentation. Then each Working Group will do an analysis of that information based on their own needs. HANDOUTS · Aquatic Working Group Study Requests: · Baker Lake Trout Evaluation · Skagit Wild & Scenic River Values (update) · Water Quality · Lewis River Hydroelectric Projects – Recreation Capacity & Suitability Analysis (REC 5) Study Plan STUDIES UPDATE R9 RECREATION USE SURVEY – ELECTRONIC MONITORING TraffiCount pulled four of the five counters on August 6, after collecting approximately six weeks of data. They will reinstall them this week. The survey crews have still been out doing manual calibration counts. Re: The long-term program, we are awaiting a cost estimate for cutting pavement and installing sensors. Chris expects to get estimates this week. He will share the data as soon as he gets it. He is also expecting a summary of the initial six weeks of data. The counter on Road 11, North of the Road 12 Junction has been in place the entire time. We plan to keep the five counters in place until mid-September. By then we should know what we’ll be doing longterm. The Forest Service wants to continue with monitoring until the end of fishing season and through the fall and winter continuously. Tony suggested the permanent counter east of Upper Baker Dam should be on Road 1107 past the turnoff to Crown Pacific lands. R7 +R8 = R14: SECONDARY DATA COLLECTION This will be a fall activity (not time sensitive). R12 DEVELOPED AND DISPERSED SITE INVENTORY We did the basic inventory work in May. By mid-September, the crew that stays on for the fall will gather additional/missing information. They have taken GPS data of all dispersed sites. These data will be shared with R2 for mapping purposes. This will help the Terrestrial Working Group identify the scope of rare plant surveys. This will tie to R11 (capacity and suitability analysis). R13 RECREATION VISITOR SURVEYS Things have been going smoothly for past few weeks. We have two crews out working on a full-time basis. The paperwork coming in all appears to be in order. Drop-box survey counts (since 145 reported at last meeting): Baker Drop Box 122 285 total so far Shannon Drop Box 18 BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT FOR 8/20/01 MEETING NOTES L Wiltse for Recreation Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 3   Interviews (since 97 reported at last meeting): Baker Interview Form 91 Shannon Interview Form 11 199 total so far Ann reported that Bayview North and South were added to the Horseshoe Cove recreation facilities operation as group sites by the Forest Service on August 13 (they had been closed to use this season prior to August 13, while the Forest Service was making facility improvements). These are now fee sites under the reservation/concession program. STUDY REQUESTS R11: RECREATION CAPACITY AND SUITABILITY ANALYSIS A question to consider in terms of how we progress from Study Request to Study Plan: · Do we keep R11 and R15 separate or combine them? We agreed to keep them separate. We reviewed the Recreation Capacity & Suitability Analysis Study Plan for Lewis River. We can integrate much from this plan into our plan, specifically: · An analysis of existing recreation facility capacity and expansion capability using facility and use area occupancy levels/capacity utilization (for developed and dispersed). · An analysis of the suitability for potential recreation development using GIS technology that assesses opportunities and constraints to potential recreation development in the study area NOTE: The timing on this is really critical. We need to coordinate with data from other Working Groups. We will need to identify any gaps in data that we will need. This will likely be a 2-stage analysis. · An analysis and mapping of desired recreation opportunities or experiences in the study area using a modified USFS-based Recreation Opportunity Spectrum (ROS) or other similar type of recreation management methodology. ROS classes will be defined and mapped for non-USFSmanaged project lands. Ann suggested that we change the wording to ROS and those aspects of SMS that apply (most likely special places). The intent is to describe what lands are there – not necessarily to classify them. · We will identify appropriate indicators and standards. R-15 RECREATIONAL TRAIL ROUTING A trail routing study using mapped GIS land and resource data, field reconnaissance, resource work group consultation, and GPS recordings to identify compatible non-motorized trail route(s) in the study area. This study would analyze alternative trail routes and required construction techniques, potential constraints and impacts of various routes, and estimated costs. The trail is intended to accommodate nonmotorized uses only. This task builds off of other GIS-based analyses in this overall study plan and is contingent upon initiation of the overall package We will table this until October when Jim is back to work on it with Chris. R5: VISUALS AND AESTHETICS STUDY Chris talked with R2 about defining all vantage points from which the reservoirs can be seen. He is waiting for that map (for both Baker and Shannon viewsheds). BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT FOR 8/20/01 MEETING NOTES L Wiltse for Recreation Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 4   These data would be used to assess fill regimes and any project facility “screening” that might be deemed necessary. Tony noted that PSE does not have sufficient information on the proposed scope of the SMSbased study, and was concerned about spending excessive study effort relative to likely results in terms of PM&E measures. Ann indicated we would be using a lot of existing data from the Forest Plan, and will gather information on examples and methodologies. PSE would be responsible for assessing the project within the viewshed of the project (looking in and out). Further discussions will continue at our next meeting. OTHER POTENTIAL STUDIES FOR 2002 · Road Access Analysis (travel) · Visitor Use Survey, year 2 (tweak form to fill gaps) · Creel studies · Land use and management information · Wild & Scenic Rivers (Skagit recreation) PARKING LOT - Visioning exercise - Organizational/agency goals - Operationally define “vicinity”, “watershed”, “project induced” - List authorities that this team must be aware of - Look at dispersed recreation with the Project as a whole. - Look into getting guest speaker from Seattle City Light - Tie education piece to ALL Working Groups - Hold periodic “outreach” meetings for feedback from other groups (hiking, horseback riding, etc.) - Land Management - SCORP data from Jim - Forest Service presentation of SMS - Trailhead surveys - Have demonstration of Charles Howard Model EVALUATION OF MEETING Things Done Well · Good limerick · Utilization of Bismarks and Mint Milanos · Lots of studies – moving forward · Lauri’s presence! · Talking through some difficult issues – without throwing things. Need for Improvement · Need to start analysis of existing studies · Missed Ardis and Dan (and Andy) TENTATIVE AGENDA FOR AUGUST MEETING September 24, 2001 Agenda – USFS Office/Mountlake Terrace 9:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT FOR 8/20/01 MEETING NOTES L Wiltse for Recreation Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 5   NOTE: BRING LUNCH; BE PREPARED TO WORK THROUGH 1.
