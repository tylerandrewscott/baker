Agenda Review Agenda Review draft management plant outlines for proposed botanical license articles: Article 508, Noxious Weed Management Plan Article 509, Special Status Plant Management Plan Article 510, Carex flava Management Plan Set date, place, agenda for the next TRIG botanical teamlet meeting New Action Items Tony to complete a project initiation form for the FSC anchor points and provide this form, + detailed maps + photographs of any potential ground disturbance on FS lands to Laura. Laura will then complete a pre-field review to determine if a rare plant survey is warranted on FS lands. Laura to send to Kathy and Tony a Project Initiation form that we can modify for our plans. Kathy to update weed list for project (from State, County, and FS lists). Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 TRIG botanical teamlet meeting, March 30, 2005  Page 1 of 4   Laura to provide Weed treatment prioritization ranking system from the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie Weed EA. Laura to contact Carl Corey about several NEPA questions about weed treatments Tony to set up meeting with Steve Reutebach from the USFS PNW Research Office to determine the process for contacting though the FS, and the associated overhead costs.  Meeting Discussion The teamlet spent most of the time reviewing and commenting on the draft management plan outlines, starting with Article 509. Article 509: Laura was interested in our pre-field surveys of upcoming construction projects, especially the Floating Surface Collector project. She also wanted to know “what our process will be for initiating rare plant surveys for projects”? She suggested using a Project initiation form, and also a pre-field review form, for pre-construction screening of project sites. Who would fill out forms and do GIS search? It was suggested a possible protocol for FS lands would be for PSE to do the Project Initiation forms, and submit these to Laura, along with maps and photos of the site, with all areas of potential disturbance clearly delineated. Laura would use this information in combination with the GIS layer to complete the pre-field review, which documents whether or not a field survey is warranted on FS lands. If a field survey is deemed necessary, it would be conducted by the FS or a consultant, according to the protocols used in the relicensing study T-16. The group provided comments and clarification on sections 5.2, 5.4, and 5.6. Kathy will incorporate these into the management plan text. Article 508: The Forest Service definitions should be the same as the State definitions for terms such as Control, etc. The weed list for the project area should be updated (Kathy to do). For section 4.2, it is important to prioritize sites, and provide criteria list from the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie weed EA (Weed treatment rankings, Laura to provide). For the question of whether or not these treatments and future treatments are covered under NEPA, we need to contact Carl Corey and get his take on several issues (Laura to take lead on this). The questions are: 1. Are we authorized to treat sites not in the MBS EA with herbicides that are covered in the FERC EA? 2. Are we authorized to treat new sites not covered in PDEA? 3. Is PDEA version adequate? 4. How do we ensure FERC EA is adequate and make sure important info is in the final FERC EA? In Section 5, Laura said that (as per the justification statement), all projects on FS land must follow the FS Policy on Plant Movement Guidelines (plant materials are to be collected from the same 5th field watershed where the project is to occur, unless FS geneticist has evidence to show that plant materials can come from further away).  Article 510: Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 TRIG botanical teamlet meeting, March 30, 2005  Page 2 of 4   Laura pointed out that if Carex flava was ever de-listed it will probably still be determined to be a Forest Service species of concern and that they may still want site protection and management. New FS rules likely to be out in approximately 2010. There were also some suggestions on several items in sections 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4. With Sarah Reichard in attendance, we began to discuss options for designing and implementing the management of the Carex flava site. Options include but are not limited to: 1) the University of Washington setting up a Graduate Student with this work as their MS project, 2) set up a contract with a Graduate student from UW with oversight from Rare Care, 3) set up a contract with Rare Care to conduct studies and implement project, and 4) pay the Forest Service to contract with the UW to provide a Graduate student, lowering the overhead costs. These options will be evaluated in the development of the plan. We would like to talk with Steve Reutebach from the USFS PNW Research Office to determine the process for contracting though the FS, the associated overhead costs, and how the program might work. There was a suggestion that we could do trial reed canarygrass treatments that would be useful in the Carex flava management program at the 7 wetlands slated for reed canarygrass management from Article 508. The combination of the budgets and protocols could benefit both programs without doing experimental treatments in the Carex flava area that could lead to moralities within the Carex flava population. We will spend 2005 developing the criteria for these treatments to add to the draft management plan. Next Meeting The next meeting will be on April 27th, and Tony will secure a meeting location and send out the notice and agenda. We will be reporting on the action items and look at updated management plan outlines, which will be presented at the May 13th TRIG meeting.
