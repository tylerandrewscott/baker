BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 1-14-03 MEETING Cultural and Historic Resources Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 2   • • •  Jessie: Made changes we discussed at meeting and sent out UDP for formal review (letterhead, etc). Jessie: Emailed reminder to Frank re: Programmatic Agreements (PAs). Frank: Sent Jessie sample PAs to share with this group.  ACTION ITEMS Erosion study results: Jessie reported that the Aquatics Group contractor (AESI) hasn’t done a technical report re erosion (just draft maps and photos). Chris Miss’ new geomorphologist, Charlie Hodges, will work with the Aquatics contractor to extract information needed for this group’s purpose. Chris will give an update in February. TCP meeting report: Jessie reported on a meeting of the Traditional Cultural Properties (TCP) group. The group has met and brought a Request for Proposal (RFP) for TCPs for tribal review. Kelly has been meeting with tribal staff (Scott, Larry and Jason) to try to come up with research designs in response to the RFP and to find out what the Tribes need re TCPs. Kelly is also engaging in archival research. PDEA STATUS RE: CULTURAL RESOURCES Pat reported that the Berger Group is preparing an outline for the Preliminary Draft Environmental Assessment (PDEA). The timeline calls for a first draft of the PDEA to be issued for internal review in May. Pat has the Initial Consultation Document information. She will look for as much refinement on cultural information as she can get by March, including archaeological resources, historical buildings and structures, and TCPs. This group’s studies will add valuable information especially on the history and pre-history of the project area. FERC looks especially at properties listed or eligible for the National Register. At the end of September, a second draft of the PDEA will be issued for public review. Information for this draft will be needed by the PDEA contractor in June. The final PDEA will be issued with the license application by April 30, 2004. Pat will use our studies for more information (not site specific) but to determine what the resources are. We will have opportunity to review the PDEA in May. Pat can be available by phone for PDEA updates at these meetings. HISTORIC PROPERTIES MANAGEMENT PLAN (HPMP) Jessie reported that she and Chris have met to talk about the HPMP. They discussed having a Cultural Resources Management Plan (CRMP), with an HPMP as a section of it. FERC just talks about HPMP but the group is thinking that it should be part of a CRMP and as part of a settlement agreement. Chris noted there are areas we may want to manage that won’t meet National Register criteria. There are also categorical exclusions, e.g., cemeteries, that may need to be managed. Also, we may have properties where tribes may not want to identify the site but we want to assure ongoing tribal consultation as part of our settlement agreement. We discussed the idea and reasons for it. We talked about how PMEs relate to the management plan. Bruce responded that PMEs get folded into the management plans (PME is analogous to “site treatment options”). The folks present generally see a CRMP as a good approach and asked for Jessie to discuss this further with USFS and FERC. PMEs PMEs being considered by other Resource Working Groups Bruce presented matrices that summarized the first draft PME options being considered by the Aquatics, Recreation and Terrestrial Working Groups. Our group reviewed the summaries and made preliminary BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 1-14-03 MEETING Cultural and Historic Resources Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 3   comments on actions the CHRWG would have concerns and questions about and/or might want input on. Scott noted that the Upper Skagit Tribe might be interested in reviewing many of the PMEs. Dee noted that first draft PME options would be available on CD by mid-February. The group also discussed how the CHRWG needs to educate other groups on the variety of actions that might have cultural impact and would need input/review. We talked about how the ongoing implementation of PMEs from other groups might create ground-disturbing, etc., and how that needs to be considered under “adaptive management.” Review from December 9, 2002 Session The group reviewed draft #2 of the issues outline put together at the Dec. 9 TCP meeting. Jessie suggested adding some resource areas to protect that had been of interest to the Sauk Suiattle Tribe (e.g., cultural plant habitats of concern). She also asked about adding “intellectual property and cultural ownership.” Members of the group agreed these should be added. UDP STATUS Jessie reported that the Unanticipated Discovery Plan has gone out to the Tribes for review. Kelly has some additional comments on the plan that she’ll give directly to Jessie. APE “FINAL” REVIEW Jessie presented the draft letter to the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) asking for review of the Area of Potential Effects (APE). The letter draws attention to the seven points defining the APE. Bob and Rob gave comments to clarify the letter’s purpose. Rob also suggested consulting with Frank regarding sending the letter to the Tribes and several other protocol matters on the letter. Group members made other stylistic suggestions. Jessie plans to send the letter out to the SHPO and the Tribes on Tuesday Jan. 21.
