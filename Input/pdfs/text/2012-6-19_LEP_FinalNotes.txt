REVIEW OF AGENDA AND MEETING NOTES The finalized meeting notes from our last meeting on February 22, 2012 have been posted to the PSE website at http://pse.com/aboutpse/HydroLicensing/Pages/Baker-River-Licensing.aspx.  Baker River Project Relicense LEP Final Meeting Notes June 19, 2012  FERC Project No. 2150 Page 1 of 3   ANNOUNCEMENTS WDFW can now fuel their boat at the project. There is a log at the fuel facility where they will sign, date, and record the number of gallons each time they fuel up. The PH4 key unlocks the nozzle. Just one key is needed and that can be left in the boat. CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS The main focus for PSE is the parking issues at the Kulshan campground and boat launch. This campground was pretty full last year. They have noted that signage doesn't work well in the absence of lines designating where to park, etc. We want to encourage folks to park in the lower parking lot instead of up and down Glover Mountain road. For the Forest Service the main focus is safety on the water. The biggest area of impact is dispersed camp sites on the east side of the lake. There are also crowding issues, dealing with parking, handling trash, etc. WDFW doesn't expect the big sudden start this year as occurred last year. This is because WDFW is opening the lake earlier in the fish run (when there are not a lot of fish). SCHEDULE WDFW will be in project area weekends and maybe one day during the week. Jeff and Jeremy will cover PMs and evenings, WDFW will focus on earlier hours as that is when the majority of the fishery traffic occurs. ORIENTATION PACKETS We reviewed the draft packet that Pam put together. We agreed on the following changes:  Remove detailed monthly calendars Add Jeff's spreadsheet (mileage, cell coverage, etc.) Add Baker Lake Contact List, current phone numbers Add phone line instructions (FS line) to Planning Calendar Overview sheet Add Heli-Spot locations, hospitals, etc. Include latitude, longitudes, transfer locations, etc. Add Koma Kulshan Guard Station, Heli-Spot, West Pass Dike to map OTHER UPDATES Jeff reported he and Jeremy have received the Combat Lifesaver Bags (purchased by the Forest Service). Baker Lake repeater: Jon reported the USFS radio is working again. Apparently, it had been buried deep enough that it couldn't get oxygen. Verizon cell service has improved. PSE added a booster antennae to the Upper Baker shop. Verizon backed away from installing the planned tower at Glover Mountain.
