REPORT ON OLD ACTION ITEMS <b7> Lloyd: Responded to May 21 versions of Communication Protocol and the Process Document by listing major issues/points of departure and sending this list to Solution Team members by June 13. <b7> Stan sent out an email to everyone who participated in putting together the May 21 versions of these documents and asked them how they would like to proceed in terms of addressing the issues PSE raises in response to these documents. They agreed to meet with PSE off-line to discuss major differences. Unfortunately, this teamlet was unable to meet prior to this meeting. <b7> Connie: Contacted Skagit and Whatcom counties re: their participation in this process. <b7> Connie: Got summary of organizations PSE has already contacted to Patrick so he doesn't try to reinvent the wheel when he goes knocking on doors to other environmental groups. <b7> Patrick: Contacted environmental organizations in the Puget Sound Area re: participation. <b7> Connie: Emailed out interests for Fidalgo Fly Fishers and Skagit and Whatcom Counties Noxious Weed Control Boards. <b7> Gary: Checked relevance of WDFW Hydro Power Plan to what we're doing.

Set next agenda (July 25) <ad> location for August 22 will be PSE Bothell office. 10. Evaluate meeting INTRODUCTIONS We welcomed: Burt Reanier (Skagit County Public Works). Burt said that he, Dave Brookings and Jeff McGowan will be representing Skagit County at these meetings. UPDATE ON PROCESS DOCUMENT AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOL The question was raised as to whether we could submit only the Communications Protocol and go forward with the ALP. Agency reps said that they would not be comfortable with doing that, as the Process Document provides some certainty about the process. Does it need to be a legal document? There was discussion about the benefits of going ALP. Benefits of the ALP include faster timeline, saving money, maintaining greater control, a better draft environmental assessment document and a settlement agreement. Regardless of whether we go ALP or traditional, our intent is to collaborate. Interested parties will get together July 6th at the FS office in Mountlake Terrace to hash out differences in the Communications Protocol and Process Document. Listed below are the issues of concern that the offline team will discuss: ISSUES OF CONCERN 1. Presence of substantive issues in a procedural document. <b7> Substantive relicensing dictates (should these be in Process Document?) a) Interim conditions b) Alternatives prior to scoping c) Studies <b7> Subjects of study requests <b7> Doing a study regardless of relevancy and relicense process <b7> Where do you draw the line? d) P. 6: Studies <ad> are historic conditions pertinent? Should studies relating to historic conditions be considered? e) Studies may be suggested at any time and resource agency studies may not be rejected (too open ended) <b7> List under what conditions studies might be rejected <b7> Document seems to give special status to resource agencies. How about the NGO's in the process? <b7> Implications that after settlement agreement, agencies still have authority to impose additional conditions. 2. Solution Team Role and Authority a) Decision-making process <b7> Interest based? <b7> Voting? <b7> Majority based?  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 6/27/2001 MEETING NOTES Baker Solution Team FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 3   <b7> Perception of changing "consensus" to "unanimous consent of resource agencies." (Agency aim was duration and refinement of Process Document after it is approved.) b) How do we define consensus? (Agency aim was balance of power.) <b7> Each Working Group has developed its own procedures for developing consensus <b7> Create guidelines for consensus (create consistency across groups) c) Role of Solution Team in resolving differences vs. control: original role was approval and dispute resolution <ad> now it seems to be more directive (of consultants, studies, facilitators) <b7> Ownership of preliminary documents (draft license application and preliminary environmental assessment) Who prepares/controls these documents? <b7> P. 5: In case of dispute over 1st Scoping Document <ad> Solution Team would make recommendations for 2nd Scoping Document. Concern this might turn costly/overwhelm PSE's viewpoint. Where do you draw the line? (Agency aim was trust/verify data collection and interpretation.) d) Study request process <ad> shifting from Working Groups to Solution Team <b7> We've got a process that is working quite well in the Working Groups <ad> why change the process? <b7> What will be the impact of Process Document on Working Groups' "norms" 3. Dispute resolution mechanism removed (Agency aim was Solution Team should be involved prior to settlement; Policy Team should get involved when time was right to start settlement discussion.) 4. Membership on Solution Team <b7> Define "other participants" <b7> Who's allowed to join? 5. Resource Agencies have unrestricted access to "all" consultants/data? <b7> Same access open to others? (Non-agency folks) <b7> Re: Confidentiality: Who decides what is confidential? 6. P. 7: Settlement package in compliance with ...Question completeness of list of laws and regulations <ad> must take into account that there are inconsistencies in the laws/regulations and should add "general" compliance. 7. Funding: Concern the process might get held up due to limited time and resources <b7> External deadlines may not impact studies? 8. How do we identify issues that would be most difficult to reach agreement on? <b7> How can we identify them early? <b7> Timeline stuff: missing from current Process Document 9. Baker Policy Team role, membership 10. Day-to-day operations of relicensing process <b7> How do we make decisions? How can we be efficient? <b7> Who are the drivers? <b7> Members should get frequent updates on process <ad> more than what's in six-month report to FERC TIMELINES Connie distributed and discussed timelines for the traditional vs. alternative licensing processes. The document that PSE is currently preparing is an updated version of the Project Information Package,  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 6/27/2001 MEETING NOTES Baker Solution Team FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 4   distributed in July 2000, which is also on the web site. This update includes process information and Working Group activities (studies, maps, etc.) Traditional path: A draft of the ICP would be ready for the BST to review July 16-27. PSE would summarize responses of feedback they get from BST members by Aug 8th. PSE would host a joint meeting with agencies and public between 30-60 days after Aug 8th, when they file the ICP. The schedule for traditional vs. ALP diverges at this point. At that time, PSE could formally request to use the ALP. If traditional, agencies have 60 days after the public meeting to prepare comments and any study requests. This would end 1st Stage Consultation. If go ALP, we would do joint scoping. This is what we've been doing to date. STUDIES UPDATE Connie distributed the Study Request/Plan Index <ad> a high-end index of 2001 field season study requests, showing status as of 6/26/01. For budgeting purposes, PSE is hoping that Working Groups will submit new study requests for the 2002 field season by the end of August 2001. DISCUSSION OF ONGOING IMPACTS Lloyd explained that PSE drafted this document in response to the issue of "ongoing" vs. "continuing impacts" raised in the Terrestrial Working Group. The US Forest Service addressed a similar issue in its "Continuing Impacts Analysis in Hydropower Relicensing for Inundated Areas," which was previously distributed to some Working Groups and to the Solution Team today. PSE finds the FERC mandate for studies is to investigate conditions based on existing (current) facility and operations and identify ongoing (continuing) impacts resulting from the current situation. Investigation into conditions prior to existing (current) operations, like "pre-project" or "since project began," are not required. Discussions of "without project" and "decommissioning" are not relevant because PSE submitted its Notice of Intent based on continued operation of the existing project. Lloyd encouraged all Solution Team members to review this paper. Gary Sprague pointed out that discussion of mitigation measures should be separate from discussion of enhancement measures, which may relate to different baseline(s) than existing (current). The question was raised: when is the right time to consider various NEPA alternatives? The current studies being done by the Working Groups are aimed at the NEPA process. EXPECTATIONS This topic has been tabled for now. NEW INTERESTS Draft Interest for Skagit County (Burt Reanier) <b7> No net loss of flood storage. Missing Interests: Interests are still needed from the following: <b7> U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (Fred Seavey) <b7> WA Department of Natural Resources (Steve Jennison)* * Have early draft  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 6/27/2001 MEETING NOTES Baker Solution Team FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 5   OTHER ISSUES <b7> Preparation for Steve Hocking's visit: Because the July meeting will focus on discussion of status of the Communications Protocol and Process Document, it was suggested that the July visit of Steve Hocking of FERC be postponed until the August meeting. Lloyd will contact Steve.
