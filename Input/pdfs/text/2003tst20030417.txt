REPORT ON OLD ACTION ITEMS • ALL: Reviewed HYDROPS request form on PSE website. The consensus was that this request form assumed a more sophisticated level of understanding of the HYDROPS model than exists among the majority of the Working Group participants. Nor is it very user friendly. • ALL: Sent suggestions for Input/Output package to Paul by April 14. An easier format might include a checklist so people would understand what their choices are in defining a model run. It would be good to display these on an input scenario form so they are easily transferable to the output form. Paul will work with Margaret to attempt to put together such an input form, using scenario request(s) from Stan and Phil. • Paul: Created a draft template of inputs/outputs and sent to teamlet members to review prior to our April 17 meeting. HYDROPS STATUS REPORT Paul reported that he, Lloyd, Mark, Joel, and Cary met with Tung and Joyce of the Powel Group on April 11 to discuss the status and functionality of the HYDROPS model. He walked us through a Powel Memorandum from that date outlining which changes to enhancements (A1 – A17) to the software would be completed by April 25. The memo also listed other software Baker River Project Relicense Page 2 of 3 Technical Scenarios Teamlet 4-17-03 Final Draft TST notes.doc; Lyn Wiltse enhancements that would be complete by June 1. There was also a wish list item (C) that was not tied to a specific time table. A limitation of the model is that is only able to use a single spawning/incubation period. Paul will return to Victoria for another visit with Tung and Joyce on April 24 and 25. He hopes to return with the model (containing the A list of enhancements). SYNOPTIC INPUT/OUTPUT OUTLINE Margaret reported that we are looking at providing requesters of runs 5 or fewer pages of output per scenario. These might include: • Title page for the run • List of all that went into the run • Time series plots • Statistical analysis Note: High frequency output will always be stored and available for subsequent analyses. Ruth will finish reviewing the A24 Study Report that R2 put out and button up with Stuart re: R2’s treatment of the IHA analysis that they included along with some additional analysis indicators that the R2 biologists feel are critical to include for the Baker and Skagit Rivers. We will want to be able to show how the Baker Project relates to the effect of the already altered flow it receives from upstream. We would monitor the 33 IHA parameters at the gage at Baker River below the confluence. We will get an update on how to integrate these parameters into our analysis at out April 25 meeting. Unregulated flows on the Skagit are not intended to be modeled using IHA. FUTURE ISSUES TO ADDRESS Assumptions (e.g., economic parameters, dependable capacity, price factors, force majeur, tc.) Hydro Climate Analysis Scenario Fisheries Definition – i.e. the interaction of the HYDROPS and R2 model post-processing Others? AGENDA FOR APRIL 25, 2003 10:00 – noon at PSE Office in Bellevue (14th floor conference room) 1. Review Notes 2. Review Action Items (and draft norms) 3. HYDROPS Status Report 4. Review draft of input request form 5. Review Baseline scenario(s) 6. Set agenda for May 5 meeting: • Include report from Instream Flows Technical Working Group mtg. on May 2. • Lyn will be out of town: Get alternate facilitator? Go without? Plan who will do the notes, etc. Baker River Project Relicense Page 3 of 3 Technical Scenarios Teamlet 4-17-03 Final Draft TST notes.doc; Lyn Wiltse
