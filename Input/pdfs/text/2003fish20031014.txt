Project:  Baker River Project FERC No. 2150  Written By:  Ray Eldridge, MWH  Meeting Date: October 14, 2003  Location:  Red Lion SeaTac Hotel  Attendees:  Arnie Aspelund, PSE Kevin Brink, PSE Ray Eldridge, MWH Cary Feldmann, PSE Frank Hella, PSE  Ed Meyer, NMFS Gary Sprague, WDFW Nick Verretto, PSE Stan Walsh, SSIT/STC Lyn Wiltse, PDSA  Purpose:  Develop performance standards and other issues supporting the settlement agreement and continue engineering design development.  Future Meeting Dates:  Oct. 29 <ad>30, 2003 Passage Sites Trip.  Nov. 4, 2003  Design Team Meeting (FSC & Net) at MWH  Dec. 03, 2003  9-3 technical design mtg at Red Lion SeaTac Hotel.  Dec. 04, 2003  9-3 passage design mtg at Red Lion SeaTac Hotel.  Dec. 10, 2003  Design Team Meeting (FSC & Entrance Module) at Baker.  Dec. 11, 2003  Design Team Meeting (Net & Net Transition) at Baker.  See handout for additional meeting dates, through license submittal date.  New Action Items Verretto <ad> Update Settlement Agreement Articles with changes provided during the meeting. Verretto <ad> Modify decision matrix to indicate FSC efficiency at 500 and 1,000 cfs flows vs. action. Verretto <ad> Provide rationale for fish numbers for stress-relief ponds. Verretto <ad> Look at upstream-most likely location of future FSC to confirm LTE 1500' from dam (see p.21, test element 2). Eldridge <ad> Update stress-relief pond memo.  Technical Memos/Reports Distributed The items distributed and reviewed at the meeting were: 10/14/03 agenda (PSE), updated long-term schedule (PSE), updated design team list (PSE), 09/09/03 draft meeting minutes (PSE), Baker River Draft Proposed Actions <ad> 4th Draft, Section 3.2 and Appendix (PSE), tentative itinerary for October 28-31 downstream sites trip (PSE), downstream fish passage stress-relief pond sizing technical memo (MWH).  Review Agenda, Minutes & Action Items Verretto <ad> Distributed handouts and reviewed general content of each.  Filename: 101403 draft minutes.doc  Page 1 of 4   Wiltse <ad> Reviewed agenda with the group. Schedule, Sequencing Verretto reviewed the schedule and indicated that a third draft of the Settlement Agreement was due on November 1, 2003. He also indicated that the year-by-year phasing of the Upper and Lower Baker FSCs begins in 2007 and that the Settlement Agreement should permit modification to the preliminary phasing plan as agreed by the parties as a result of preliminary testing and logistic issues which may develop. Sprague noted that the schedule should be in an appendix to the Settlement Agreement and that is should serve as a "yard stick" for measurement of performance, and that some flexibility should be allowed. Settlement Agreement Article Development (Section 3.2) Wiltse led a page-by-page review of the fish passage article and appendices. Discussions addressed: overall passage settlement schedule, performance standards clarification, decision-making impacts to schedule - FSC modification, evaluation, and compensation. The upstream text was edited and accepted. Changes were unsubstantial. The downstream text was substantially modified from the previous version by Kevin and Nick, albeit only to remove the confusing segments of the previous text, rather than to change the substance. This version was presented to the group for editing. Few changes were made until the decision process for moving from the 500 cfs FSC to the 1000 cfs FSC was discussed. Feldmann asked what would happen if we were getting better FSC/system performance than the standards in one area, and could we trade that better performance for an area that had lower than target performance? Meyer noted that he had not encountered that before and that he would defer to Steve Fransen for a decision. Sprague suggested a decision matrix showing efficiency vs. flow to aid the process, which the group developed to try to show how a decision might be taken to progress from the (Phase 1) 500 cfs FSCs to the (Phase 2) 1,000 cfs FSC. The matrix was recorded by Verretto and is attached to these minutes. Verretto was to edit the matrix to ensure its accuracy. Stress-Relief Pond Size, Design, Location Eldridge led a discussion of the draft TM for the stress-relief ponds that would be located near the confluence of the Baker and Skagit Rivers. The facility was sized for a maximum of 150,000 fish per day. Nick will provide the rationale for this number to Ray for inclusion in the TM. The group requested that the estimate of numbers of fish be expanded in the TM as well as looking at methods of water to water transfer of fish from the hauling trucks to the ponds. The intent is to place as little stress on the fish as possible. There was also a request to look into the cycle timing of how lots of fish would be placed into the ponds and the holding times that would be provided. Meyer requested the development of a fish-friendly method of fish release from the trucks or trailers into the ponds, such as backing the truck into the water or by using suction hoses or chutes. It was agreed that PSE/MWH would expand the TM and address the comments made. Other Issues None identified.
