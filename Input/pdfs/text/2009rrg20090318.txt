APPROVAL OF FEBRUARY 24, 2009 MEETING NOTES We reviewed and approved the draft February Meeting notes with a few additions to Agency Consult Comments section on page 3: - Added “and assumed to be occupied” to end of second bullet. - Changed “two issues” to “three issues” and added “3. Tree removal due to aesthetic reasons” to last bullet. These changes will show in italics on the final version of the notes. Field Trip Debrief: We all took a walking tour of the resort area to review each tree slated for removal. A brief summary of our observations and discussion follows: In day use area: Near first cabin – pruning is okay in that area (19 inch tree). Conifers have an important purpose with climate control. They tend to limb themselves. They also provide wind shelter – taller canopy trees. They also offer some protection from predation. We agreed that the 19” conifer will remain and can be limbed to open up the view. Need to be careful to fall trees away from habitat areas. Where possible we will prune instead of remove. Just past the second cabin we will retain some of the hardwood trees and remove some of the smaller conifers. Near the beach, wind off the water was a concern. If we open up the front end (near the water) there might be impacts to climate further back. We will assume this is occupied habitat. We removed flags from two 20 inch trees. Discussions indicated concern for lay-down techniques. Ann assured us that they would try to direction fall in every case. We will fall all hazard trees and leave large limbs for Marbled Murrelet. We will leave most where they lay - especially those on the periphery. We may have a harder time doing this in the interior. At the end of the field trip we discussed possibly re-aligning the road to take advantage of naturally open deciduous area, with more deciduous than conifer. This would help keep a buffer between the entrance and the campgrounds. We could buffer the forest and the people both. This would also mean moving the kiosk further back by the road. We need also to consider whether 40 foot long rigs can make it into these campgrounds and into these sites. That is why we changed that intersection – to accommodate these large rigs. Want to look at retaining some of the shorter snags (rather than removal where possible) for woodpeckers and small animals. There are safety considerations here (for the faller as well as for any unsuspecting resort visitors). This will differ by tree, depending on use and where it is rotting. We will leave behind Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project No. 2150 RRG Final Meeting Notes, March 18, 2009 Page 2 of 5 some vertical structure if at all possible. Next Steps:  Jamie – Document the plan according to what we agreed to during the field trip.
