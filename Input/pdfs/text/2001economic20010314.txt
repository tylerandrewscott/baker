Hydrologic study investigated down ramp events on Skagit River: PSE Baker Project; interactions with Seattle City Lights operations; and effects of tributary inflows. Sue Madsen reported on R2's investigation of three years Baker River and Skagit river gage data for six locations at 15-minute intervals. Focus was on downramp events [ river stage decreased by more than 6-inches within one hour ] and lag times [time difference between start of downramp event at upstream-most gage and the start of the downramp event at each downstream gage. Typical lag time from an event at Concrete to reach Mt Vernon gage was 7-8.5 hours. Typical lag time from an event at Newhalem to reach Concrete gage was 6.5 hours and to reach Mt. Vernon gage 14.2 hours. Other slides indicated event effects on magnitude, duration. Combinatorial effects of Skagit and Baker events with Tributary flows was also discussed. A copy of the presentation will be available on Puget's Baker River relicensing website. Sue also distributed hard copies of the presentation. PRESENTATION ON FALL/WINTER SKAGIT RIVER FLOWS Lloyd Pernela distributed copies of newspaper articles from The Courier Times 3/7/2001; Seattle PostIntelligencer 2/23/2001; and a Puget Sound Energy press release entitled Drought Threatens Puget Sound Energy's effort to Protect Skagit River Salmon. He presented graphs of cumulative precipitation from September thru January for the historical period 1966-2001 plotted against the 2000/1 season at Upper Baker Dam. It was only in mid-November that the region had the first indication that precipitation was not tracking with normal expectations. He walked the group through various scenarios of real time gage data from USGS gages on Skagit and Baker Rivers from Aug. 01 through Feb. 28th. He reviewed water levels for the Sauk, Skagit, and Baker Rivers, as well as Lake Shannon and Ross Reservoir. He also distributed the Lower Baker outage schedule. The outage at Baker began on March 8 and is scheduled to conclude mid July. He reported they expect to be at full pool by mid May. Stan expressed appreciation for PSE's collaborative efforts in working to restore river levels since November. He also cautioned that there is a critical need for PSE to continue to work closely with tribes and agencies to reduce the likelihood that a de-watering event such as occurred in November is repeated in the future. EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN (EAP) Chris Drechsel presented an overview of Puget's current Emergency Action Plan for the Baker River Project. He distributed handouts to supplement his talk. The plan addresses requirements within the FERC Dam Safety Program and included periodic independent as well as FERC inspections and evaluations. The bulk of the plan deals with PSE's internal procedures in getting the word out to appropriate emergency response agencies when they uncover a problem. Another component of the plan is that it provides flood inundation maps. Chris posted the latest version of this map. The map assumes the worst case situation: a disintegration of Upper Baker Dam followed by a disintegration of Lower Baker Dam, at full pool, during a 100-year flood event. PSE is in the process of updating the maps and converting them into an electronic format.  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 2150 L Wiltse for Economics/Operations Working Group.  3/14/2001 MEETING NOTES Page 2   Common EAP activities are: Annual review and update of the EAP; annual "telephone drill" involving all plan holders (local fire and police, county DEMs, FERC, Red Cross, PSE, etc.); annual training of Baker Project personnel; and "functional exercise" every 10 years.
