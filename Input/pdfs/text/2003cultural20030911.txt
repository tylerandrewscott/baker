TCPs may be involved. <b7> Kelly: Get info to Pat <ad> ethnographic database and the area included (TCPs). <b7> Jessie: Meet with Chris and Kelly to develop plan for fleshing out HPMP. <b7> Jessie: Send notice to tribes that Historic Resources report is out for review. Highlight the four themes identified by HRA. <b7> Scott: Pull together list of tribal issues associated with PMEs (to present at August meeting).  HISTORIC PROPERTIES MANAGEMENT PLAN (HPMP) We started with TCPs as the area we most wanted to use group time to discuss. If you have comments in addition to what we discuss today, please send to Chris Miss by 9/17 if you want them included in the draft HPMP that goes out on 10/1/03 with the License Application.  3.4 Existing Conditions for TCPs We decided to add detail regarding the Upper Skagit tribal lineage and how they're connected to the project. The other tribes will also have the opportunity to clarify their relationship to the project (through Kelly).  3.4.1 Methods We decided to provide more detail regarding the process (e.g., who met with whom). The CHRWG meetings should also be included as part of the process. We'll refer to individual consultants in the text as "the contractors." Particular consultant names will be cited in text as reference citations.  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 9-11-03 MEETING Cultural and Historic Resources Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 2   3.4.2 Results We will add some information that no sites have been identified but some areas of interest have been identified; however, none of these have been evaluated under National Register criteria because the tribes have not yet decided whether to evaluate any of these. We decided if there are areas of interest that won't be evaluated, we'll include these in 5.2.3 so that they'll be included in the management plan without the 106 requirements. Regarding these areas, PSE and the tribes will consult, and if a USFS nexus is established, USFS will be included in plans if a tribe continues to want to bring these areas forward.  4.1.3 Effects of TCPs We decided to add detail regarding the characteristics (potential character-defining features that we're worried about the project affecting) of TCPs. Kelly will do this.  4.3.3 Assessment of Adverse Effects of TCPs We decided that we can address non-106 TCPs in 5.2.3. TCPs under 4.3.3 should be limited to 106eligible properties. Some appropriate PMEs under 5.2.3 would include topics such as habitat enhancements for resources not addressed by other working groups and access.  5.4.4 Tribal Coordination We decided to add language to clarify that individual tribes can coordinate with other parties (e.g., PSE, USFS) without necessarily going through the Cultural Resources Advisory Group (CRAG). The Upper Skagit Tribe is considering the best way for PSE to provide an annual Upper Skagit workshop to address management of cultural resources in the area.  5.1.1 Site Specific Measures for Archaeological Sites Jessie raised the question of whether the group is in agreement (especially USFS and tribes) regarding recommendations particularly around data recovery. She asked how we can have this conversation. Chris answered questions regarding specific sites, noting that she was working on a cost estimate for completing the work. We decided to add that PSE will develop in consultation a treatment plan that includes a research design for data recovery for each of these sites in consultation. This plan will be developed in consultation with the tribes and with concurrence of SHPO and USFS. The treatment plan will be submitted within eight months after the filing of the License Application. We will include in this plan that ways will be sought to protect two specific locations where protection might be feasible.  5.4.5 Curation USFS doesn't have a curation agreement with North Cascades but PSE could pursue one.  6.3 Schedule Jessie distributed a proposed schedule for implementation. The group reviewed it and asked clarifying questions. We will convert the dates into "license" schedule language.  5.2 Additional Studies We should add that PSE should partner with the Concrete Heritage Museum Association on a (possible oral history) project regarding history of Concrete as it relates to the project.  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 9-11-03 MEETING Cultural and Historic Resources Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 3   5.4.7 Training and Education Kelly raised the importance of assuring that training of designated PSE on-site persons be sufficient to pick up on potential activities that would be issues under the Plan, especially unanticipated discoveries. Section 5.4.7.1 seems to address this. General Comments <b7> A definition section would be helpful for clarification. <b7> Acronym list would be helpful. <b7> It is difficult to tell the difference between the "Project" and the "APE." Be consistent. <b7> "Eligible" versus "recommended eligible" <ad> In Historic Structures section, everything is listed as "eligible"; in Archaeological section, everything is listed as "recommended eligible." Why? They should currently all be "recommended eligible by PSE." We should add a preface saying that they are being treated as if there is concurrence even though we realize there is not yet. PSE needs to complete a NPS/1090 form to get concurrence from SHPO. <b7> "Listing" <ad> Should we give PSE a task to apply for listing the eligible properties? Jessie will research this. CONFERENCE CALL WITH FERC We asked Frank how many copies of the draft HPMP he wants on 10/1/03. He said two. He also confirmed that PSE can distribute the draft HPMP to the CHRWG members for the 90-day review. We then reviewed the procedural flow chart on page 44 of the second draft HPMP.
