REVIEW OF AGENDA AND MEETING NOTES The final meeting notes from our last meeting on February 25, 2014 have been posted to the PSE website  Baker River Project Relicense LEP Final Meeting Notes October 21, 2014  FERC Project No. 2150 Page 1 of 5   at http://pse.com/aboutpse/HydroLicensing/Pages/Baker-River-Licensing.aspx. LEO REVIEW OF 2014 SEASON Whatcom County: Mason noted that it worked out really well when he and Jeremy used to split the patrol territory north and south. That wasn't possible this summer with Jeremy's absence. This translated into a lot more windshield time for Mason and less boots on the ground. Activity up north picked up compared to last year <ad> especially at Artist's Point. Baker Lake was well managed overall. He thanked James for helping to backfill Jeremy's position. There was a good amount of OT. Lower Sandy was a little rowdier this year. Concessionaire HooDoo said this was one of the best seasons ever as they didn't have to call for assistance from Whatcom County. Challenges: Kulshan Campground needed more attention late night. Hosts complained that after midnight and early morning hours things got noisy. Mason will change his time to cover late nights there on Friday and Saturday nights. Forest Service: James explained that staffing for the foreseeable future (through September, 2015) is expected to be flat or reduced by 5%. That means for patrols they will be down to Ray and Jeff and not able to hire until October, 2015. This is unfortunate as the Baker/Snoqualmie Forest is the second most visited forest in the nation. They anticipate that the 2015 season will be substantially the same as this season. There were fewer issues than last year and many of the issues were within the Wilderness areas up north. Overall, there was a doubling of hours and contacts. Ray was on duty every Thursday and Sunday. James went along for three patrols. They are looking at doing the same with Ray and Reardon next season as they did this past season. There were issues with residing, dogs, sanitation, and some traffic stops. Many people don't understand that smoking marijuana is not legal on federal (Forest Service) land. There were two arrests related to drugs this season. A lot of verbal warnings were given. Compared to last year, warnings went from 35 to 65. Violation rose from 21 to 35, incident reports from 12 to 22. As Carol steps down, Cindy will help with the paperwork for the contract next season (5-Year Master Plan) with Whatcom County. WDFW Report: Ryan reported they have been successful at maintaining a safe and orderly fishery. WFDW officers continually impress upon the public the need to be good stewards and part of the solution and not the problem. They had a frustrating year in that the high expectations for more fish were not met. The reason is unclear. Some believe that higher temperatures in Puget Sound diverted a lot of the sockeye north. Many fish didn't show up until the end of the season. The numbers were strong the end of July and August. They logged 300 hours on the whole and hope those hours can stay the same next season. Boat safety enforcement <ad> keeping the public safe on the water:  Baker River Project Relicense LEP Final Meeting Notes October 21, 2014  FERC Project No. 2150 Page 2 of 5   There were more warnings issued this year. They were strict on life jacket issues. Many people don't understand the Whatcom County fire extinguisher law for gas tanks that are not enclosed. The boater safety card requirement has been almost completely phased in. Inspections went up a lot. WDFW is down one person in Whatcom County. They are working to get Sedro-Woolley station filled. While there were some resource damage issues and thefts, there were no goats in boats and less nudity than last year. WDFW continued to do their early morning checks on dispersed sites. They didn't receive as many complaints about waking campers. July Stats: <b7> Contacts = 1030 (1140 last year) <b7> Warnings = 164 (up 34%) <b7> Citations = 6 (down 74 %) <b7> Boat Safety Inspections = 179 (48 last year) <b7> F&W = 117hrs (48% of time) <b7> Boat safety = 65 hrs (26% of time) <b7> Aquatic Invasive Species = 37 hrs (15% of time) <b7> General Recreation = 19 hrs (7% of time) <b7> Drugs, traffic, misc. = 2 (19% of time) August Stats: <b7> Contacts = 801 (460 last year) <b7> Warnings = 139 (up 34%) <b7> Citations =18 (down 74 %) <b7> Boat Safety Inspections = 85 (48 last year) <b7> F&W = 110hrs (49% of time) <b7> Boat safety = 61 hrs (27% of time) <b7> Aquatic Invasive Species = 0 hrs (0% of time) <b7> General Recreation = 38 hrs (17% of time) <b7> Drugs, traffic, misc. = 15 hrs (2% of time) Worth Noting: <b7> Staffing levels were reduced by 40% from 2012 <b7> Sockeye fishery opened on Baker Lake on July 10 (after fourth of July weekend at the request of the Forest Service) <b7> Returning Baker River Sockeye in 2013 was 12.5K. 2014 run was 13.8K (much less than expected). <b7> 2 aquatic invasive species check stations were performed in June and July this year <b7> Overall contacts this year were up 13% <b7> Overall citations issues down 4% <b7> Boat safety inspection took huge jump from 58 to 264 Skagit County Report: Chris was pleased to report they will have contract in place for 2015. This season they patrolled Lake Shannon over the 4th of July weekend and also the opening day of the fishing season. They did 40 hours  Baker River Project Relicense LEP Final Meeting Notes October 21, 2014  FERC Project No. 2150 Page 3 of 5   of boat patrols without additional OT. They are looking to see if they can accomplish more dedicated OT in 2015. There is a kokanee fishery at Lake Shannon. The boat ramp area is day use only. Forest Service FPOs Ann expressed appreciation for everyone's combined patrol efforts this summer. Overall the basin looked good <ad> things were fairly calm. The Forest Service had a four-person crew on weekend patrol (Friday through Monday). Seth was crew supervisor, working with Jeff, Rex, and McDonald. One day each week was for maintenance over the 4.5 month season. With 540 hours per person, over 1000 contacts were made by the weekend crew. These contacts weren't all law enforcement. They also included public contact, fixing signs, maintenance, fixing toilets. New boat: They put a 24 foot boat on the lake this season with a dock at Swift Creek. The boat was on the lake all summer. It is available for emergency use by other agencies. Ann encouraged all crews to touch base with the FPOs and vice versa. It is good to share what is going on. They are a great resource. COMMUNICATION Camp hosts appreciate it when LEOs touch base with them. They need to work on touching base with the OT officers to clue them in on what's going on and any situations they may be going into. Instead of the message line that was set up a couple of seasons ago, they are using the drop box. They are also using radios and email as well to keep each other informed, especially for late night shifts. They are providing cell phone numbers for the officers. The best way to keep each other informed is to physically touch base <ad> when you see their car stop and do a face-to-face with them. It is best to share schedules more than a week ahead of time. Mason agreed to the following: <b7> Email a Whatcom County contact list send to Seth, Ray, Dan. James, and Brian <b7> Email weekly schedule the beginning of each week to same distribution. <b7> Give Whatcom County LEO schedule to Ray a week ahead along with email list of contacts. DAM SAFETY Miriam distributed a brochure on dam safety and its implications for the Town of Concrete and PSE's Baker Project dams: Upper Baker, Lower Baker, and West Pass Dike. The brochure will be on Skagit County's website, is already on Town of Concrete website, and will be on PSE's website as well. The focus is on Lower Baker as it is in closest proximity to the public. There are three sirens in the Town of Concrete. They test them once a month. There are concerns that they sound like fire station sirens. PSE is collecting feedback on how to move forward- either replace the sirens or use other emergency notification systems. There is also an Emergency Action Plan. PSE worked with the Town of Concrete and Skagit County to prepare an evacuation map. Suggestion: Post evacuation route signs. RAM FUNDS In October of 2015 the second half of the 2016 RAM funds ($25K) will become available for use in the 2016 season. STATUS OF EQUIPMENT FUNDED FOR 2014 SEASON  Baker River Project Relicense LEP Final Meeting Notes October 21, 2014  FERC Project No. 2150 Page 4 of 5   <b7> John, Jeff, and Ryan all have the trail cameras. The cameras came in late and they weren't used much this season. They will likely be more widely used in 2015. <b7> Cell phone boosters were not purchased as they did not work.
