We will primarily document agreements and action items. RESOLVE Groundrules and Criteria Following are the original RESOLVE ground rules agreed to by the working group: • Work at understanding one another. • Use airtime wisely. • Speak honestly and respectfully. • Examine assumptions. • Make tentative agreements, then look at the whole package together. • One meeting review rule: we have one meeting to review and change the tentative agreements of the previous RESOLVE session.1 • Document our agreements. 1 All agreements are tentative even after the “one meeting review rule”. However, the one meeting rule gives regular participants an opportunity to bring an agreement back to the table while assuring that tentative agreements are not forever reopened. It also accommodates regular participants who must miss a meeting and may want to weigh in on a decision. The group also agreed that materials to be considered at the RESOLVE session would be sent out in advance, per regular working group rules, if group members were expected to attempt agreement on those materials. Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Terrestrial Resources Working Group Page 2 of 5 • Caucuses are okay. • For each PME, we will begin by identifying the goal and measurable objectives • We will use the 5/7/03 PME’s, as updated, for our RESOLVE discussion. • After we have agreed to a PME, Marty will revise it to reflect our agreement. Only after that will draft settlement language be written. July 17th Agreements The group confirmed its tentative agreement on the following PME’s (as contained in the 7/29/03 draft PMEs): • 1.1.3 Late-seral Forest Habitat; • 1.2.3 Mountain goat Summer Habitat Enhancement • 1.3.1 Osprey Nest Structures When Gene Stagner joined the group later in the meeting, the group decided, by consensus, to delete 1.1.2, Beneficial Reservoir Vegetation. The group held a more detailed discussion about 1.3.2 and reached the following tentative agreements. 1.3.2 Loon Floating Nest Platforms Agreements • Marty will re-draft the article to clarify PSE’s maintenance responsibilities. • Regarding terminating the program if it is not successful after 15 years (See “Description of Action”)—where nests are successful, they will be continued. “Success” is judged based on breeding attempts. The group held a more detailed discussion about 1.3.4, 1.3.5 and 1.3.6 and reached the following tentative agreements. 1.3.4 Bald Eagle Management on Non-Project Lands Agreements • In # 3) under “Description of Actions”, specify that compensation will go for trees in excess of government rules and not to offset the cost of what they’re already required to do. 1.3.5 Bald Eagle Management on Project Lands Agreements—Okay as is Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Terrestrial Resources Working Group Page 3 of 5 1.3.6 Bald Eagle Monitoring Agreements • The survey discussed under “Description of Action” will look at known sites and has some level of effort to find new ones. • The report from the surveys go to the BRCC and the Terrestrial Resources Implementation Group. Acreage Issue Discussion of Interests At the 8/8/03 meeting, the group had begun to discuss interests. At that meeting, PSE had stated two interests. They were: • Certainty—knowing what the economic costs of the measures will be • Profitability—not merely overall profitability but need to meet “prudent” test by WUTC At the 8/21/03 meeting, we picked up from where we left off. PSE added one interest with respect to acreage: • Need to be able to sell the “reasonableness” of this measure internally Following were other interests around the table: NPS—As part of the BAWG, we want to see lost acreage mitigated for. USFS: • Mitigate for continuing impacts to wildlife habitat • Contribute to Natural Resources health in a balanced way • Conduct business in a way that fosters confidence and trust among USFS stakeholders Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation • Fear of continued development encroaching further on wildlife habitat. Wildlife habitat is going fast. Other BAWG interests: • Replace the habitat lost by project through PSE or some other entity that could set a direction resulting in saving/improving habitat • Maintain natural biodiversity of the area Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Terrestrial Resources Working Group Page 4 of 5 • Make sure that the effects of the project on wilderness are monitored over time Agreements • BAWG will meet to refine and prioritize its acreage needs and identify the amount of protection needed for various acreages. • PSE will convert its February proposal into a dollar amount. • Together, at the next meeting, we’ll see if we can come up with a dollar amount that covers the needs. Then, we can develop a plan based on that amount.
