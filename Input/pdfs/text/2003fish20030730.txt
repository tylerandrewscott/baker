Baker Agency Group (BAG) BAG Fish Passage subgroup Gary Sprague - WDFW 30 July 03 Draft Summary of BAG July 30th conference call. Participants: Stan Walsh SSC Jim Stow USFWS Ed Meyer NOAA Steve Fransen NOAA Gary Sprague WDFW Note: These notes have not yet been reviewed by the participants. The new floating surface collectors for the Baker River Project should be designed and built to: 1) Meet criteria (screening, attraction, trapping, etc.) at a flow of 500 cfs, with the capability of increasing flow up to 1,000 cfs. 2) In the first year be able to physically and biologically test the facility at 500 cfs and 1,000 cfs. 3) Depending on the results of the testing, add a section on to the front of the surface collector to test different entrance configurations. It may be necessary to use flows above 500 cfs to keep certain variables constant (e.g. entrance velocities) 4) Depending on results, expand the facility to meet criteria at a flow of 1,000 cfs. 5) Modify and test configuration of entrance of 1,000 cfs floating surface collector. The testing and modification schedule will need further discussion. We will need to identify all of the variables that need to be tested, before we can finalize the testing order and schedule. There is a desire to test multiple variables within a single migration season. For example, using acoustic tags we can observe differences in fish behavior between 500 cfs and 1,000 cfs.
