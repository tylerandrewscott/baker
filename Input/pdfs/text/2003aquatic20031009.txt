QUOTES OF THE DAY "The power of computers and Stuart Beck's mind have set us back." - Phil Hilgert (in reference to having too many options for habitat analyses) "We are awash in data. It's time to make decisions." <ad> Cary Feldmann  Baker River Project Relicense Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File:9:11:03; Lyn Wiltse  2 of 8   FISH PASSAGE TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP REPORT They have not met since our last meeting. They will be meeting October 14 and 15. We will get a report at our next meeting on November 13.  STUDY REQUEST SUBMITTALS/STUDY PLAN DEVELOPMENT  Study #  Title  Notes/Next Steps  A01a Reservoir Tributary Habitat Surveys The Tributary Habitat and Production Potential  Executive Summary was distributed at our  September meeting. Phil distributed the CD along  with colored maps for the entire draft report. We  will discuss this report at our next meeting. In the  meantime, please get your questions to Arnie by the  end of the month. (The report is out.)  A01b Reservoir Tributary Biological Surveys See A01a. ACTIVE (The report is out.)  A01c Reservoir Tributary Delta Surveys  See A01a. ACTIVE (The report is out.)  A02 LB River Habitat Mapping  (The draft report is close to being out.)  A03 Reservoir Fish Population  Not discussed.

A04 LB/Skagit River Flow, Gaging A05 Water Quality Sampling A06 UB Passage Design Baffle Modification A07 Lower Baker Forebay Bathymetry A08 UB Passage System Evaluation A09A Skagit River Flow and Habitat Assessment  Not discussed. These data were incorporated into A09a hourly flow routing model. ACTIVE Nothing new to report. Complete. Complete. Complete. The Instream Flows Teamlet met September 25. They are still in the model development phase. Phil is looking for input on hourly habitat models. R2 has made adjustments to the analyses based on feedback received at that meeting. Critical drivers for these tools are down ramping rates and varial zones. We need to agree on statistics, (a comparison tool), to use across all scenarios that will best represent these issues. Phil explained that there is a question of time step in operationally defining varial zones. The rate of insect re-colonization is most rapid during the first 28 days. He illustrated that whether we use 7, 14, or 28 days, while the quantity changes the relative comparison remains unchanged. The hourly model allows us to define the upper extent of the varial zone, the lower extent, which transects we look at, how we weight the transects, monthly, seasonally, etc. The aim of the next Instream Flows Meeting will be to decide how we  Baker River Project Relicense Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File:9:11:03; Lyn Wiltse  3 of 8   A09B Salmonid Redd Selection and Maintenance in the Middle Skagit in Response to River Fluctuation from Hydropower Peaking A09C Distribution, Timing and Depth of Salmonid Redds A09D Distribution, Timing of Salmonid Fry A10 Baker River Delta Habitat AssessmentChar A11 Nutrient Addition A12 Instream Flows for Bio-diversity A13a Water Quality Impacts of Human Uses of the Reservoir and Adjacent Shorelines A13b Water Quality Impacts on Aquatic Habitat A14a Reservoir Shoreline Erosion  will analyze varial zones and ramping for comparative purposes across many scenarios. Phil also reported that since the September 25 discussion on ramping, we have now included critical downramp flow (hourly). Stuart is working on incorporating State downramp guidelines. Critical downramp flow drops out the effects of flood events. At the next Instream Flow Meeting, we will confirm what we will use to define critical flow. Once we finish with the hourly models, we will turn our attention to the daily models. (The executable program for the model was transmitted by July 18. Initial results were out September. PHABSIM and side channel results should be out by November 2, along with backwater slough ) Nothing new to report. Draft Report was distributed; Phil explained that this is an interim report that looks at dewatering of redds. It will become "draft final" in January after we have incorporated results from the fall spawning surveys. The report now includes Steelhead. He pointed out a table (on p.45) that shows where various species spawn. Timing of these is illustrated on p.44 of the report. Please let Phil know if you would like to see the data in this report illustrated differently. (Report is out.) Nothing new to report. (Draft report and proposed juvenile periodicity will be out by November ARWG meeting.) Complete. Tie to A26. Split between R-A21 & R-A09. Removed from list of studies this group will address.

She walked us through each of the eight sites, describing conditions at each. We prioritized the sites that should be added to the list of sites where there is an erosion-related concern from an aquatics resources perspective. The site at the abandoned road between Channel Creek and the Delta was a fairly high concern. The site at Shannon Creek was of moderate concern. Sue will copy us on her response to Greta. Sue and Doug will ground truth these sites in the next week or so. All were asked to consider any other erosion concerns related to aquatic resources. (Final draft report will be out by November ARWG meeting.) Sue explained that this survey covers sockeye spawning distribution as well as scour. We are continuing to monitor scour at the transects, to confirm observations from 2001 and 2002. Volunteers are welcome to help with the spawning surveys. Chuck, Derek and Ruth expressed interest in assisting. Reservoir margin spawning is the final component of this survey. R2 has mapped potential, sites as good (spring, upwelling) fair (at least 50% cobble/gravel), and poor. (This is underway- we are collecting data.) (We are proceeding with Phase 2. We will get a status report at the November ARWG meeting.) Scott will look into this to see if there is energy to pursue it. Merged into A01a and A01b. This study has been combined with A26a. The final draft report was distributed in August. This is being addressed by A9 and A24. Cancelled when non-native trout stocking in the reservoirs was discontinued. This is being addressed through A15. (A Final Draft Part 1 will be submitted by our November meeting. At the TST, we distributed a sample Level 4 Output with the new period of record and corrected values based on the NAVD '88 datum change.) (Sample effort is over. The draft report should be out by our November ARWG meeting.) 5 of 8   A26A Reservoir Limnology-Production Potential A26B Tributary Production Potential A27 Middle Skagit Incubation Flows A28 Fish Passage-Reservoir Management A29 Estimate Sockeye Production from Different Incubation Sources R-A30 Near-Field Smolt Behavior R-A31 Fish Passage-Far Field Smolt Migration R-A32 Fish Passage-Kelt Radio telemetry R-A33 Fish Passage-PIT Tag Migration R-A34 Fish Passage-Downstream Run-Timing Correlation R-A35 Fish Passage-Upstream Run-Timing R-A36 Native & Wild Inland Fish Population Assessments R-A37 Without Project Alternative (evaluation of Aquatic & Riparian Habitat) R-A38 Bull Trout Population Assessment & Risk Analysis R-39 Native Non Salmonid  (Arnie reported that they have received some new scale analysis information from WDFW and new scale data from the 2003 sampling. They will talk with Asit about how to incorporate these data into the report. We will find out how this new information affects schedule for final report and discuss plans for peer review at our November ARWG meeting.) See A01 above. Addressed in A9.

Revised study request pending from Mark DownenWDFW. Sue distributed additional A37 charts in response to Arn's request at the last meeting. (We will get an update on the draft report progress at our November ARWG meeting.) (Scott reported that he and Ruth are working on blending this into the connectivity PME.  RESERVOIR REFILL Phil reported that currently, we cannot start re-filling until March 1 due to flood control requirements and try to achieve a near-full reservoir by Memorial Day. Phil reviewed with us some charts showing changes in the euphotic zone depths which we'll use to calculate euphotic zone volume. We can use euphotic zone volume to compare alternate re-fill scenarios. This will give us a measure of reservoir productivity. We also reviewed tables of inflow volume calculations and tables of updated tables of energy values.  OTHER STUDIES We reviewed the study schedule and updated it to reflect present circumstances. These updates are in parentheses at the end of comments in each study in the table above.
