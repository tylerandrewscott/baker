Evaluate meeting  UPDATE ON WATERSHED ANALYSIS The FS Watershed Analysis will be out to contributors for final review by month-end. Carl Corey will present relevant sections to this group at our October meeting. He will also discuss the Northwest Forest Plan.  SOLUTION TEAM UPDATE The Technical Working Group is still making edits to the Communication Protocol and Process Documents. The next Solution Team Meeting will be October 24, at the Forest Office Mountlake Terrace  <b7> NEW ACTION ITEMS <b7> Tony, Tom, Don: Look at re-writing RT-12 <ad> Look at vegetation studies results for reference. <b7> Tony: Work with Lauri to draft study request for Phase II of T-5 <b7> Tony: Contact Laurel and Bill re: RT3, RT6 re: Can they revise/consolidate the study requests for the group to review and then be better prepared to address questions at our November meeting? <b7> Lyn: Call Patrick re: schedule change and climate information. <b7> Tony: Get draft T15 data from Joetta (after she gets the DNR & Crown Pacific cover types). <b7> Fred: Send Group list of federally listed species of concern. <b7> Bob: Send Tony list of species of special concern in the Park so he can distribute to team members. <b7> All: Prepare any new 2002 study request forms and get to Tony before end of September.  REPORT ON PAST ACTION ITEMS <b7> Ann: Confirmed with Don our September 18, meeting at USFS office at Sedro-Woolley <b7> Lauri: Reserved Mill Creek/ Lacey locations for October and November meetings. <b7> Tom: Emailed handouts to Tony to include within the minutes. <b7> Tom: Updated T5 study to include edits, sent to Tony who sent out as Working Group Approved. <b7> Tom: Updated T4 matrix and sent to Tony to distribute to members for comment/review.  STATUS OF: T2: Vegetation Mapping in Project Area BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 9/18/2001 MEETING NOTES L Wiltse for Terrestrial Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 2 of 5   Tom distributed an update outlining the cover types mapped as of September 12. They expect to complete the upland forest vegetation mapping on Baker Lake by the week of September 30 and Lake Shannon by week of October 28. They will complete grass-sedge communities and wetlands in the spring of 2002. We agreed to add a new cover type: UPLAND FOREST-WETLAND MOSAIC. T15: Basin Vegetation Mapping Joetta (R2) has reviewed the Forest Service cover types. She has the contacts for DNR and Crown Pacific. She hasn't gotten data from them yet. We'll get an update at our October meeting. T5: Wetland Inventory Study Tony distributed the Working Group Approved Final Study Plan. We reviewed the three drawdown cover types added to 3.1.1 NOTE: Fred suggested we do a study on downstream influence of project operations on Skagit wetlands (from Aquatics Working Group). T11: Oregon Spotted Frog Inventory No spotted frogs have yet been identified. Identification at the tadpole stage is very difficult. We will be raising some tadpoles and enlisting the help of an expert to identify others. This study will be complete in the spring of 2002. T13: Survey and Manage Terrestrial Mollusk Survey Will get started October 1-15 for this two-week survey. T17: Amphibian Studies inn Reservoir Fluctuation Zone Tom distributed an update. We'll review results at our November meeting and determine additional sampling areas for the spring. These areas might include streams that were: <b7> Too dry or high to sample <b7> In previously inundated reaches. T-4: Analysis Species Assessment Tom distributed an update on this assessment. We reviewed the Analysis Species Matrix. The "High Economic Value" column will include YES for all game species. Lia will continue to fill out the matrix for species known to be present in the Basin. We will prioritize species to study according to our flow chart. We will then run the entire list by tribal representatives to see if there are any additional species that need to be added. We hope to have this list complete by year-end.
