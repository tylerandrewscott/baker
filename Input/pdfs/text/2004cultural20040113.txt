REPORT ON OLD ACTION ITEMS <b7> Jessie: Buttoned up with Russell Holter (OAHP) and Frank (FERC) re: HBS review timeline. We are on schedule. Note: The study is not confidential in terms of cultural resources, but it is restricted from an infrastructure standpoint. <b7> Jessie: On December 2, sent out confirmation of December 9 meeting. <b7> Bob: Reported that it would be premature to share treatment/monitoring plans from Ross Lake. The table of contents is now available, but the written document has not yet had tribal review. Bob will discuss the table of contents with Chris prior to our next meeting. <b7> ALL: Got any additional comments to Kelly re: the Ethnographic Overview she put together. <b7> Jessie: Emailed out the November 24, 2003 PME Status Table to everyone. Since then she has also sent out a table that was updated in December 10, 2003.  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT Cultural and Historic Resources Working Group 01-13-04 Meeting FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 2   <b7> Jessie: Talked with new curator of North Cascades National Park, Kelly Cahill, regarding curation possibilities. Kelly came today to our meeting and gave a presentation.  SCHEDULE Jessie walked us through a memo from Rob Mohn outlining the schedule of deadlines for the next version of the PDEA. We also reviewed the milestone list for the broader relicense schedule. We agreed to get comments in on the HBS and Archaeology reports by January 26 and on the HPMP by January 30.  Note: Jan will be out of town from just after our meeting on February 10 until February 27.  HPMP DISCUSSION How do we adequately address effects of known actions? <b7> Include as much site-specific information in HPMP as possible. <b7> Build in method to incorporate new knowledge (flexibility). Much of the unknown will be handled through Adaptive Management. Unanticipated conflicts will come up. We need a mechanism to provide for re-direction. We anticipate relationship building and information sharing throughout the term. <b7> State more explicitly that there will be a cultural resources review of future actions.  Chris encouraged team members to read the HPMP as it addresses the concerns noted above.  TECHNICAL SCENARIO TEAMLET (TST) REPORT Lyn reported that the TST has been meeting regularly and is hoping to approve a flow regime that meets economic as well as cultural/environmental interests at their meeting January 16. She'll give us an update at our next meeting.  4.1.1 IMPLEMENT THE HISTORIC PROPERTIES MANAGEMENT PLAN We reviewed the language for the draft license article 4.1.1. Rob had voiced concerns about the section that states the HPMP will continue in the event that the Programmatic Agreement is terminated. Frank strongly suggested keeping the language the way it is because it is accepted FERC language and assures that cultural resources will be protected, as provided for in the HPMP in the event that "dark forces" cause the termination of the Programmatic Agreement (PA). Jan felt strongly that the FERC language could be interpreted as requiring adherence to the HPMP even if the PA was terminated due to concerns/inadequacies with the HPMP. After considerable discussion, members suggested the following language be inserted (replacing "In the event the Programmatic Agreement is terminated, the licensee shall implement the provisions of its approved HPMP."):  If the PA is terminated, FERC will follow the 36CFR 800.3-800.7 regulations.  After further discussion, it became clear that there was not consensus by team members to use this language. Jessie will organize a teamlet of Jan, Kelly, Rob to propose wording for Draft License Article 4.1.1 and send out to the entire team to review by the end of the month.  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT Cultural and Historic Resources Working Group 01-13-04 Meeting FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 3   4.2.1 Provide a Cultural Resources Enhancement Fund (CREF) Jessie introduced this PME and explained that it follows the model being used by other resource Working Groups in the relicense process. She further explained the name change to ("enhancement") to distinguish it from Management Plan. The Cultural Resources Advisory Group (CRAG) (which will function as the Cultural Resources Subcommittee of the Baker River Coordinating Committee (BRCC) would provide oversight for this funding. The aim of this PME is to provide an Adaptive Management funding measure to capture future needs/opportunities we are not presently aware of. It might also provide the ability to address things outside the existing Management Plan such as enhanced research, etc. We agreed to use the proposed funding schedule: Annual Funding Years 10-19 (2015-2024) $20,000/year x 10 years=$200,000 Annual Funding Years 20-25 (2025-2030) $30,000/year x 6 years=$180,000 Total CREF Fund (16 years)=$380,000 Unallocated funds would roll over from one year to the next. Next steps will include establishing priorities for how this fund would be spent. For now, we agreed to put in placeholder language at the end of the Description of Action section stating that the CRAG would identify priorities and limitations (such as geographic boundaries) and develop criteria for funding use as one of their initial actions (March-April timeframe): "The CRAG will identify priorities, criteria, scheduling and mechanisms for implementing the funding process." HISTORIC PROPERTIES MANAGEMENT PLAN (HPMP) Chris is eagerly awaiting feedback from team members on the HPMP. We agreed that the deadline for getting comments back to her would be extended to January 30. UPDATE ON TRADITIONAL CULTURAL PROPERTY (TCP) STUDIES We agreed to separate the Ethnographic Overview into two reports: <b7> Status of TCP investigations (Licensing-related information) <b7> Ethnographic Overview (Vital ethnographic information) Kelly reported the licensing information report will be out by February 2. The Ethnographic Overview will be out by March 1.  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT Cultural and Historic Resources Working Group 01-13-04 Meeting FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 4   Consider: Modification of this report to create a public version (approved by the tribes). Perhaps this might take the form of a picture book? A poster?  The Upper Skagits are in the final stages of completing their short item report. They have submitted their research design for a long-term oral history project.  The Sauk-Suiattle have submitted the research design for their oral history project.  The Swinomish are still considering how they want to proceed.  Note: The Upper Skagit Indian Tribe does not feel that the other two tribes should, in any way, be obligated to follow the process or format they used for this.  ARCHAEOLOGY REPORT: HBS (Revised Report) We agreed to propose the archaeology sites as a district. Tribes would comment and SHIPO would approve this. Chris will develop a configuration of how this district might look. She'll send this out for review by February 1, along with a draft DOE. Jessie will check with Frank (FERC), regarding signature requirements and the role the Forest Service plays in this.  CURATION Kelly Cahill, Curator of the North Cascades National Park, shared the following things we should consider related to curation: <b7> Scope of collections (artifacts and natural resources) <b7> How we will decide what to include <b7> Space needs: o Rent? o Agreement re: maintenance/upgrade/staffing, etc.? o Environmental controls <b7> Existing facility? <b7> University of Washington's Burke Museums (State Repository) <b7> Other available facilities <b7> Personnel - NPS now requires curators in charge of collections to be at a GS-11 level. <b7> Training and travel <b7> Software access/databases for collection management (North Cascades has proprietary archiving software). <b7> Archive, retrieval functions <b7> Photos, paintings, drawings <b7> Collection and curation maintenance guidelines are available from the NPS. <b7> Exhibits (show electronically? Use brochure? Photo reproductions? <b7> National Park Service issues oversight reports periodically. <b7> Kelly oversees the curation of over two million objects. They are filling the space as fast as they can build the facilities! <b7> Multi-disciplinary collections are not a problem.  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT Cultural and Historic Resources Working Group 01-13-04 Meeting FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 5   We would like to see artifacts from this process maintained locally, as a single collection. Seattle City Light and the Muckleshoot Tribe have curation facilities that are good models to follow. Jessie will follow-up with Kelly re: costs.
