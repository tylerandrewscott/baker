The need for facilitation will decided by the group upon review of the upcoming meeting’s agenda. If the meeting is to consist of technical presentations then facilitation should not be required. Also, facilitators may vary depending on availability and who is used for overall Baker licensing, but the group will judge performance of any facilitator. Biological Data distributed: Schedule for releases, pool elevations, and study 1) Weekly Studies plans for each study conference reviewed calls regarding Biological Studies Summary study status Nick reviewed the study plan, which is based upon a forecasted will start on 120% inflow water year.

Pool elevations start at elev. 685’ on April 29th. May 13th, 20th, Tuesday 28th, Jim brought up issue of how long fish will be monitored. When June 3rd and monitoring period is done, and anticipated tag life is over, then June 10th. comparison of those fish for that specific treatment will be Time for all terminated, however the fish will be followed until the end of the tag calls will be life. 1:00PM Discussion on how variables will be separated in the study came up, 2) Site visit – specifically if it is expected that pool elevation will be a significant view juvenile factor. MaryLou clarified that the recent evaluation of historical date facilities, adult revealed that the significant correlation was photoperiod, and there trap, and was no relationship to pool elevation. Correlation was for all species spawning combined, and without separation of recent vs. later years. beaches, and release: May 8th MaryLou reviewed near-field acoustic study. For near-field, studies PSE will will start with Coho since they are hardier than Sockeye. Distribution provide of hydrophone arrays reviewed. For far-field, will use radio telemetry lodging at the and start with release at Little Park Creek. Plan to release in high Baker Lodge pool and then in low pool to determine if there is any effect of this for those who variable. During transition week there will be no tagging releases so wish to spend as to separate these studies. the night in order to continue the Ken – will there be a confusion to far-field fish during release during Baker Passage transition between generation on and off? It is assumed that there meeting the will be no velocity changes detectable in far-field. Assume that this next day will primarily affect near-field fish that will be in the reservoir at that (Previously time. scheduled meetings at MaryLou wants the keep study parameters clear, this is why it is not SeaTac are a normal operation scenario. Jim was concerned that shutting off canceled those generation will create eddies that will move around the reservoir, days) which can confuse the fish? MaryLou asked how far back this effect would occur? MaryLou openly considered measuring such 3) Mention to backcurrents/eddies, but the velocities would be so low that Doug Bruland conventional equipment could not detect. to consider feeding or PIT Tag Study was reviewed. For far-field, fish taken from upper careful Baker Trap. For near-field, a nested study, fish taken from monitoring of Upper Baker Trap released 1 mile from and near log boon, to the kelts now provide an idea of the travel time form various locations to the being held. collector. For each for far or near-field, have a release of 20 fish in front of the gulper to determine the time the fish spend circulating in the collection area. Ed Meyer asked about use of the double coil detector. MaryLou indicated that the manufacturer claims the detector to have a 99% accuracy of detecting tagged fish. Kelt Study, no changes. Kelts have now been collected and are being held at Upper Baker hatchery. Some are now dropping their eggs, and if they have not dropped they will be stripped prior to release. Steve Fransen – pushing start date back, stated he was concerned that the Kelt die of starvation, or be seriously affected by lack of nutrition by the release date. Doug is collecting twice the number of fish. Kelts can be feed while being held others have done this, and Doug is requested to look into feeding the fish. At start of each week (on Monday, at 1:00pm) have a conference call with anyone who wishes to check on status of the studies MaryLou will contact field crew and relay status. Anticipate that the subject of the call would be just general status of the study and if it is proceeding as planned. Telephone number distributed. Downstream Design Review and Presentation Mort asks that Surface comments on Collector and Alternative FL3 reviewed. This is designed using pumps. Have not distributed MIS Screens reviewed use of gravity yet. Sequentially pulling water out as water TM’s be moves down though screen. Need to keep transport velocity up, received week hence the floor rises. Design velocity is 4 fps. Study data from existing gulper will let us know how fish are attracted to such a flow. Structure is floated. velocity is controlled with pumps. Pumps can be tied together or separated into separate wells. There may an aversion for fish entering a high velocity flow field right at entry into screen. Comments Screen velocities: Ed recommended considering velocity acceleration from 2fps to 4fps from the entrance to the ramp and secondary area. Consider shutting off front pumps to control velocity at entry to screen. Approach and entrance conditions will have to minimize environmental changes requiring behavioral modification to avoid rejection. Stability Questions arose regarding stability of floating structure. It is possible to set pumps so they come on and off as water level rises or decreases. Some stability is achieved by virtue of structure size. Use of weirs to control flow: Ed recommended MWH consider controlling flow through the screens with weirs which will go into a common wet well with common pumps. However there could be a stability problem without a feedback loop to control the water level. Debris on screens could affect water level. With a weir system, suggested multiple pumps at end. Or could put weirs where pumps are. However must be concerned about thrust of the pump output since they are so large. Steve asked if it would be possible to tie pumps into penstock, such as Mayfield? Mort will examine this concept. Site Plan: Mort present the site plan view of this option, which provided size of structure (at Lower Baker). If this structure was located next to baffle then its size would block almost all of baffle. Mort reviewed pumps, and depth of collection wells, which would require more study. However, if going deeper, then structure would need to be longer. Cleaning issues: Ed recommended that we do away with brushes and go deeper, at least in first section. Main concern is how to clean. Mayfield maintains constant depth throughout slot, so brushes can go down throughout the whole structure. Also, brush systems are complicated, may wish to consider backwashing, however this is a problem with the pump system. Right now tend to clean daily with large cleanings as required. May find more debris with the finer screens that will tend to clog screens that now are passed through. Nick suggested adjustable depth. Wayne recommended that we also consider redundant pump that could be used as a backwash system. Kelts: Can possibly have Kelt rejection from too narrow a slot at the end of the screen. Need to consider. ACTION: Revise TM based on comments received Suggested that we wait until get biological studies to determine width/depth of screens. Are examining the same concept for Upper Baker. Advance Upper Baker barge MIS (High TM was not handed out but Mort commented on his concerns, which Speed) he is considering with this alternative. Currently examining two Screens locations for intake tower, amount of generation may affect need for a barrier net, so looking at moving upstream so barrier net can be kept. At Upper Baker, because of intake baffle, need to consider flow balancing problems. Balancing is a problem because a pipe throughout the barrier net and one going through the MIS screens, may result in the majority of flow going through lower one and not much through upper pipe and associated screens. Have 20-35% of flow going through upper baffle, with screens this may go down to less than 5%. Also looking at full high-speed screen but have problem matching with generation. Howard Hansen may provide a good list of high-speed screens. Eicher screen should be added on, Puntledge, Elwha, etc. can provide information on this.

Complexity of alternative makes it impractical, and should note that all these complexities add up to rejection.

Steve noted that many of be reserved for settlement agreements are not specific and lack clarity. only a few select alternatives, as many may not be preferable, but also may not be "Fatally Flawed”. Another term for this evaluation category will be developed. Tramway, Fish Mort completed a review of these facilities throughout the country. Locks and (Reference TM 7.0) Purpose of review was to determine if any of Elevators these alternatives would be feasible at the Baker Project. Some of these facilities are not in use, or only work with upstream and not downstream. All locks in US are less than 100 feet high, although Oren Dame in Scotland does have a 200 foot lock. Coast are successful, but are these considered feasible alternatives, and need to look at transportation requirements. Also, the scale of what would be required at Baker is must larger than any existing facilities, although the tramway at Round Butte was 400 feet long. Also have a grain tram that could handle 6800 lbs. per car, and 14,000,000 lb. per day. However, if fish are trammed to Lower Baker and then to Upper Baker would have a loss value assigned to each transport facility, with a truck have only on loss factor. Also would have fish placed into Lower Baker and then need to be captured again at Upper Baker. U3.1 and U3.2 are also considered feasible at this time but will require additional examination. Jim Stow would like to have management objectives be considered. Meeting In conclusion, at next meeting MWH will develop details of high- Next meeting is Summary speed screens and Gulper systems and incorporate comments on on April 2nd. Conventional Screens that were made today. Hopefully alternatives that show a high degree of feasibility can be short-listed due to biological, operational and other concerns. By April or May we will have alternatives refined to point where we can wait for results from biological studies, and then using this information start elimination of certain alternatives and refinement of remaining alternatives to select the preferred alternative. Study data will be available September or October. Facilitation Group decided it was not required at the next meeting. End of Meeting April 2nd Proposed Meeting Agenda 1. Review Notes and Agenda 2.
