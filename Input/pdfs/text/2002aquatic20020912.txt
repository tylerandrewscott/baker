REVIEW LICENSE SCHEDULE Arnie distributed the most recent version of the relicensing schedule and the schedule for aquatics studies. It was suggested that, for future aquatics meetings, Arnie distribute only the single summary sheet. This will save paper and make it easier to review the schedule at a glance.  SOLUTION TEAM UPDATE Arnie distributed the FERC approved versions (dated August 2002) of the Communication Protocol and Process Document. They are bound as they won't be confused with the many previous drafts. The Solution Team has delayed their October meeting to October 30 to give Working Groups as much time as possible to come up with their draft PMEs.  SETTLEMENT PROCESS Dee facilitated the group in initiating the "sorting process" of the brainstormed list of PME options based one the following: <b7> Is it (the option) legal? <b7> Does it address a Project impact, protection or enhancement need? <b7> Is it technically feasible?  We listed the following assumptions in reviewing the brainstormed list: <b7> Project stays in place <b7> Flood control at least at current level  Baker River Project Relicense Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 9-12-2002; Lyn Wiltse  2 of 8   <b7> Legal requirements have to be addressed  We reviewed the list silently and then shared our findings. We made it through page two, amending the Potential PME options as necessary in order to pass the legal and feasibility tests.  Next steps: Continue sorting the spreadsheet. We agreed to do this by meeting all day, Oct 18 at the Baker Lake Lodge. We will meet on October 17 for our regular meeting to discuss studies, etc. All are encouraged to come up and spend the night if they can attend both meetings. Let Arnie know as soon as possible.

ACTIVE ACTIVE Complete. Complete. Complete. Main Stem: Transects were tentatively selected in July and confirmed during a site visit on August 16 with Stan, Cary, Brad and a Forest Service contractor; two transects were re-located to better represent the range of habitat conditions in the middle Skagit. On August 22, the transects were brushed out and surveyed and measurement procedures were coordinated with field crews. We put in pressure sensors at Deadman's slough inlet and also at Lower Day creek and in the mainstream of the river near Lower Day Creek inlet. We are checking for water level and temperature changes due to changes in river flow stages. August 27-30 we collected data on velocities, bed profile, and stage at all mainstream cross sections at  Baker River Project Relicense Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 9-12-2002; Lyn Wiltse  3 of 8   A09B Salmonid Redd Selection and Maintenance in the Middle Skagit in Response to River Fluctuation from Hydropower Peaking A09C Distribution, Timing and Depth of Salmonid Redds A09D Distribution, Timing of Salmonid Fry A10 Baker River Delta Habitat AssessmentChar A11 Nutrient Addition A12 Instream Flows for Bio-diversity A13A Water Quality Impacts of Human Uses of the Reservoir and Adjacent Shorelines.  11,500 cfs. Next week will be surveying the channel profiles along the banks and classifying substrate and cover at each vertical along all 26 transects. We will be collecting data on low flow conditions in early October and hope to look at high flows the end of October (hoping for rain). Off Channel Habitats: We will be measuring habitat conditions and velocities at six side channels and sloughs as described in a handout describing field procedures. On August 21, 22 we installed transects and surveyed cross sections and longitudinal profiles at three side channel inlets at approximately 11,000cfs. We hope to monitor low flows in early October and high flow conditions in late October. Sue distributed a draft of the Study protocols that will be used for off-channel habitat surveys. Phil will meet with Stan to discuss how to address the issue of behavioral responses. ACTIVE? We are continuing with the spawning surveys. We feel like we have pretty good coverage. We will be doing these surveys every 10-14 days. We expect to start seeing many chinook. Gary warned us that these runs might be late this year. ACTIVE Not discussed at this meeting. We just got the NMFS collection permit (August 2002). ACTIVE Complete. Note: USFW is concerned with impacts to char and indirectly to bald eagles through chum and also to cutthroat. Tie to A26. Split between R-A21 & R-A09. Removed from list of studies we will address. Brady reported the USFS will not pursue this.

She noted that A24 gives us relevant information on processes. The current condition of the fan is an "existing condition." However, there are opportunities for enhancement over existing conditions. Sue guesses that the interest of the Study Request was "natural conditions". She suggests we focus on enhancements we could do in terms of existing conditions. We will do some research on existing literature to identify what actions and conditions make sense given the land-form. We need to look at what is feasible and will be effective given the hydrologic conditions and the presence of the weir. We will be coordinating efforts with the Corp and SFEG. Sue will discuss this direction with Stan and Devin (SSC) and perhaps assist them in revising the initial study request. We will discuss this at our October meeting. Study request pending from USFS. This is related to A36. Brady is in the process of re-working it. Merged into A01a and A01b. ACTIVE. This study has been combined with A26. ACTIVE This is being addressed by A9 and A24. No longer necessary due to change in management direction in favor of cancellation of non-native trout stocking in the reservoirs. Removed from list of studies we will consider. This is being addressed through A15.

Nick will get with Stan and review its status. Additional comments are welcome. Nick talked with Brady, Stan, Gary and Phil. They came up with a consensus to send this to a new consultant. The scale data is still being entered <ad> will be ready by end of September so we are running two weeks late from the original schedule. All other data are ready to go. Nick is putting together a list of possible consultants for Stan and Gary to review. We should know who the consultant is by our October meeting. Emily will be collecting outstanding data the week of September 16. We are putting together a model looking at stream length, gradients and widths. We will be presenting a recommendation for fish densities at our October meeting. We will need to make a decision shortly after so we can get the production estimates set up by fall. Addressed in A9. This is being developed in the Fish Passage Technical Working Group. ACTIVE We are still awaiting comments on the Study Request. Nick will meet with Stan to discuss.

This is related to A17. Brady is working with Mark Downen of the WDFW to rework this. There is an opportunity to collaborate with the Terrestrial Working Group (T7) here to see if important aquatic habitat parameters can be added to terrestrial habitat considerations.
