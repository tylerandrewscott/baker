NOTES FROM RESOLVE MEETINGS To permit the greatest degree of open dialogue, the group agreed that notes for the RESOLVE sessions will be less formal than regular working group meetings. We will primarily document agreements and action items. RESOLVE GROUNDRULES <b7> Work at understanding one another. <b7> Use airtime wisely. <b7> Speak honestly and respectfully. <b7> Examine assumptions. <b7> Make tentative agreements, then look at the whole package together. <b7> One meeting review rule: we have one meeting to review and change the tentative agreements of the previous RESOLVE session.1 <b7> Document our agreements. <b7> Caucuses are okay. EDUCATION GOALS Mechanism to provide funding (over the term of the license) for (conservation) educational activities that: <b7> Are diverse in terms of themes, approaches (multi-media and multi-temporal), constituents (all age groups and underserved and minorities) <b7> Have nexus to the project <b7> Place based (within the Baker Watershed) and resource based <b7> We recognize that the effects of this will also have broader (social, etc.) implications <b7> Are flexible, adaptable, and appropriate over time, and are sustainable <b7> Promote stewardship (broadly) <b7> Supports existing programs and/or provides complementary programs <b7> Are effective (meet goals and have measurable outcomes) 1 All agreements are tentative even after the "one meeting review rule". However, the one meeting rule gives regular participants an opportunity to bring an agreement back to the table while assuring that tentative agreements are not forever reopened. It also accommodates regular participants who must miss a meeting and may want to weigh in on a decision. Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Recreation Resources Working Group Page 2 of 5   <b7> Are cost effective <b7> Include partnerships that are sustainable (this will help activities be sustainable) This mechanism will include an oversight function (goals, fund distribution, methods to evaluate, etc.) This PME will be a component of the Recreation Management Plan. This plan will be complete within (at least) 2 years of license issuance. Interim funding will be available. We, as a shared resource group, should be able to ask the Rec. Subgroup and/or the BRCC for additional funding from its pool of money. TYPES OF EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES* * Consider context/part of curriculum, would include support/materials, etc. <b7> Educational multi media (websites, etc.) <b7> "Stewardship" activities (one-on-one with folks in the Basin) <b7> Day (indoor and outdoors) <b7> Field trips (schools, sr. centers, general public) <b7> Teacher workshops <b7> Conferences <b7> Curriculum development <b7> Seminars (field based) <b7> Outreach BRCC BRCC will be an umbrella organization tasked with adaptively managing resources over the term on the new license. Each of the resource groups (including Recreation) will have a subgroup within the BRCC. We suggest an Education Subgroup of the Recreation Subgroup of the BRCC. Another alternative would be to have designated "education experts" attend the Recreation Subgroup meetings when topics of education are on the agenda. POTENTIAL MEMBERS OF EDUCATION SUBGROUP USFS, NPS, PSE, Local ESD, WSTA, NCI, Whatcom and Skagit Counties POTENTIAL CRITERIA FOR APPLICANTS <b7> Government Organizations <b7> NGOs: 501C3 and 501C4 <b7> Favor partnerships and matching funds Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Recreation Resources Working Group Page 3 of 5   <b7> Include multi-year programs (up to 3 years) <b7> Existing programs could also apply for funding Consider whether it would be appropriate to consider religious groups for funding. Dave will check to see if PSE is legally precluded from doing this. LIST OF PARTICIPANT INTERESTS The following list was developed by meeting participants at the start of this RESOLVE session.
