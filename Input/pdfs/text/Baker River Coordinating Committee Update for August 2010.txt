Our next face-to-face meeting is currently anticipated to be on October 27 at a location to be determined. Last year at the fall face-to-face meeting, we conducted a brief business meeting followed by a walk through the license. We have heard that a license walk through may not be necessary but a discussion of the settlement may be. We like to know if you think this would be useful exercise for this year. Also we would like to know if you have topics of interest for the agenda. Please let me know. In the mean time we will continue to reserve the 4th Wednesday each month for a conference call or face to face meeting as needed. Thanks again for your enthusiastic and dedicated participation, Cary BRCC update for August 2010 Aquatic Resource Group (ARG) The ARG met on August 10th at PSE's Snoqualmie Operations Center. PSE provided the latest updates on the adult fish trap operation, the season's juvenile outmigration results, Spawning Beach 4 renovation and the fish hatchery operations. They reviewed the chart for adult sockeye returns to the Baker River from 1965-2010 showing historical results on the sockeye return of an estimated 22,427 (includes ~4,000 harvest). They have had the highest single day collection on record of nearly 2,000, the return well exceeded pre-season forecast and escapement levels allowing both tribal and recreational sockeye fisheries in the Baker River near Concrete, and a recreational sockeye fishery in Baker Lake for the first time ever. The hatchery has fulfilled it's goal for 3,800 spawners (which could yield about 5 million eggs). PSE is working through punchlist items on the adult fish trap and hatchery and renovation continues on Spawning Beach #4 with that project on track. The separation walls are complete and the pond liners are being installed. PSE also reported on the season's results for the Upper Baker FSC operation. Over 517,000 juvenile fish (436,000 sockeye and 80,000 coho) have been collected and transported downstream. The outmigration season has ended and downstream passage facilities have been shutdown. The next Fish Passage Technical Working Group meeting is scheduled as a conference call on August 26 at 9 am. That meeting will include discussion of the UB FSC performance study for 2011. A couple of outages are scheduled for the adult fish trap to file:///C|/...ti/LOCALS~1/Temp/A9R2896.tmp/Baker%20River%20Coordinating%20Committee%20Update%20for%20August%202010.htm[1/6/2011 10:19:30 AM] allow for modifications to the trap prior to the onset of the coho run to address issues with the crowders and unanticipated fish response to the trap design learned from the sockeye return. After the general fish facilities operations updates and a brief review of the aquatics plans and reports schedule, the ARG meeting was concluded and the Aquatic Riparian Habitat Working Group convened to review comments on the 505 plan and do a walk-through of the implementation procedures for the 505 plan. The next steps will be to distribute the first Request for Proposals in October. The ARHWG will then meet following the November 9th ARG meeting. The next ARG meeting is scheduled for September 14th as a face-to-face meeting from PSE's Snoqualmie Operations Center with video conferencing available at PSE's Skagit office in Burlington. Terrestrial Resources Implementation Group (TRIG) file:///C|/...ti/LOCALS~1/Temp/A9R2896.tmp/Baker%20River%20Coordinating%20Committee%20Update%20for%20August%202010.htm[1/6/2011 10:19:30 AM] The TRIG met on August 5th, split between the Burlington and Snoqualmie PSE offices using WebEx, conference call, and video conferencing. Ira provided an update on possible properties, including a property TRIG has looked at before. The landowner has renewed interest in possible trades in the area, thus changing the status of that property. TRIG also authorized pre-acquisition survey activities on "Property G." Bob K. and Brock reported on a property they visited last month (Property J). The site has about 22% coverage of cottonwoods and a good component of maple, so there is already good usage by our targeted species. Acquiring the parcel would protect some high-quality habitat that acts as a migration corridor to a passage to the Nooksack drainage. They believe this is a good parcel to consider for Deciduous Forest funds. By consensus of all present, the TRIG authorized PSE to enter into preliminary negotiations regarding "Property J." A formal decision will be required before any funds are authorized toward purchase. Marty reported that he talked with Mark Hitchcock about Forest Practices rules and learned that we may need to submit an Alternate Plan to DNR in advance of any major clearing work. Tony and Marty will invite Mark to a TRIG meeting in the fall to help us understand the implications of possible management activities on the site as well as the related rules and procedures. By consensus of all present, the TRIG authorized PSE to spend up to $25k for the five Alder Creek sites identified for gates and/or ecology blocks. They asked PSE to continue to monitor the gate 2 area for opportunities to further restrict ATV access. Kathy and Scott went to the Alder Creek property to look at Carex comosa, a state-listed sensitive species. They found more than 50 plants in the emergent wetland areas (management area #4). They noted that this is a biologically diverse area. A short management plan for this species will be included in the SA 509 report. Scott reported that ivy removal at the old spawning beaches at Baker is being rescheduled but will happen soon. There is a Carex flava visit scheduled for 8/19. The next Botanical Teamlet meeting is scheduled for October 6th. Mel reported that an aerial survey was conducted 7/19. There were four active osprey nests, two with chicks present. There will be a formal report at the next TRIG meeting. Haley also noted that there was a bald eagle nest with chick on Lake Shannon. Eagles have been spotted around Baker during the boat surveys, but no active nests could be seen around Baker Lake during the helicopter survey. Haley and Mel went out with an arborist to evaluate the 13 osprey nest trees and 19 additional nearby trees identified for potential alteration. Mel is having the tree crew begin work on the trees this month. Costs for modifying the nest trees will be paid through the osprey nest article funding; costs for modifying the additional, nearby trees (estimated to be $10-15k) will be billed to the Legacy Wood article. The next TRIG meeting is scheduled for September 2nd at the PSE Snoqualmie Conference Center offices. Recreation Resources Group (RRG) RRG met on Tuesday, August 17, at the Skagit Service Center A draft of the Water Safety Tear-sheet map, for Baker Lake, was presented so that the group could identify and discuss specific content and graphics that would be included on this information sheet A conceptual Aesthetics (screening) plan, for the Upper Baker Compound area along USFS 1106, was presented for comment and review. The draft for the swimming delineation scope for Horse Shoe Cove was reviewed, as a part of the Water Safety Plan, SA 304. 2009 Draft annual reports for recreation were sent to the agencies for 30-day review on July 30 and August 2. Next RRG meeting will be held on October 19 at the Skagit Service Center from 9:00-12:00 Law Enforcement planning team will meet following the RRG meeting, on October 19, 2010, from 12:30-3:00 p.m. Cultural Resources Advisory Group (CRAG) The CRAG had a scheduled meeting on August 28, 2010. Upon start of the meeting, we became aware that no CRAG members would be able to attend, so the meeting was used to work with consultants on technical issues and schedules necessary to support major projects at Baker. Notes were taken and will be distributed to the CRAG for review. The final Historic Properties Management Plan is on schedule to be submitted to FERC for approval by September 30, 2010. Comments on the final draft of the HPMP were due on August 6, 2010. The only comments received were form the MBSNF. PSE sent a letter to the CRAG with a determination of "no historic properties affected" for the proposed new power house file:///C|/...ti/LOCALS~1/Temp/A9R2896.tmp/Baker%20River%20Coordinating%20Committee%20Update%20for%20August%202010.htm[1/6/2011 10:19:30 AM] construction at Lower Baker. Comments or requests for more information are due September 6, 2010. The next scheduled meeting is September 29, 2010 at the Burlington Skagit Service Center. CRAG members are encouraged to attend in order to discuss potential impacts form the Lower Baker Dam Improvement Project on historic properties at the project.
