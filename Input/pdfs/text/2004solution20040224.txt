BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 2/24/2004 MEETING MINUTES Baker Solution Team <ad> Lyn Wiltse, PDESA Consulting, Inc., Facilitator FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 2   <b7> Steve F. and Gene: Check with Steve H. of FERC re: timeframe for draft and final terms and conditions. Delay notice by 60 days? <b7> Kris: Get length (30 <ad> 50 years) of licenses of comparison projects on cost sheets provided by him. <b7> Kris: Get background on Aquatics costs as shown in columns 10/03 and 02/04 on cost sheet. <b7> Connie: Send out email with supporting cost data for each Resource Group. <b7> Connie: Create "Master list" of remaining relicensing meeting dates and send out. <b7> Connie: Email policy people list to all members. <b7> ALL: Come to Policy Team Meeting with your BATNA in mind (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement). SETTLEMENT PROCESS UPDATE /WORK PLAN PME Status Dee distributed the updated PME Status Table. She outlined the Major Outstanding Issues: <b7> Instream Flows (Add 1, 2 or 3 turbines? Looking at options for flows within each scenario) <b7> Aquatic/Riparian Habitat (Terrestrial at $7 Million & Aquatics at $20 Million) <b7> Flood Control (PSE and Skagit County are meeting regularly to define a PME to address this issue. They will keep us informed of their progress.) The Solution Team needs to keep the full package in mind as we work to resolve these issues. Discussion included a placeholder/re-opener in the license for additional flood control and what that might mean to other pieces of the settlement. Concern was also expressed about the lack of related technical information within the relicense timeline. PME Cost Sheets Kris reviewed the economics cost sheets with reference materials put together as a result of the action item received at the last meeting. Participants expressed appreciation for this. Review Disposition of All PMEs. Including Cost Estimates Dee reviewed PME descriptions and costs submitted to the Louis Berger Group for inclusion in the PDEA. The PMEs were organized by resource area and costs totaled accordingly. POTENTIAL AREAS FOR DISCUSSION We asked if there were issues that could be resolved at the Solution Team level, without elevating them to the Policy Team or sending them back to Working Groups. The major unresolved PMEs are: <b7> 1.1.1, 1.3.2., 1.3.4/3.4.4 (habitat) <b7> Recreation (costs) <b7> Instream Flow (Effect on dependable capacity is a large cost item. See "Announcement" on page 2 of notes for background.) <b7> 3.1.1 Fish propagation <b7> Flood Control <b7> Others  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 2/24/2004 MEETING MINUTES Baker Solution Team <ad> Lyn Wiltse, PDESA Consulting, Inc., Facilitator FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 3   CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE POLICY TEAM 1. Need people with authority to agree. 2. People with a multitude of hats. 3. Commitment to consistency (same people at meetings). 4. Solution Team members to brief policy people in advance. 5. Allow time for "sidebar" caucuses. (We decided to use the first meeting to serve this purpose.) 6. Don't negate what one policy person says. 7. Policy people need to know pros and cons of various options. 8. Understand "differences in interests" and commit to seeing that all interests are met. 9. Present big picture <ad> focus on dilemma. 10. Time for non-license stakeholders to meet. 11. Define what we're going to do on flood control (placeholder vs. action). 12. Strategy <ad> Work to address the two major issues first (flood and flows) as these as the big ticket items and possible show stoppers.  SUGGESTIONS FOR MOVING FORWARD Have the Policy team focus on "deal breaker" issues: Instream Flows Flood Control  Do Policy Team meetings include attorneys? Yes, to the extent they constitute the technical support. Policy people would sit at table with support folks behind them. We would have facilitators for these meetings and document key decisions (on flip chart) for the record. We agreed that the initial Policy Team meeting would be WITHOUT PSE. This will give other participants in the process the chance to caucus to come up with a unified option for solution in reaching settlement. The meeting will be facilitated.  Draft Initial Policy Team Agenda March 15: 9:00 am. <ad> 3:00 p.m. at Embassy Suites in Lynnwood  NOTE: THIS INITIAL MEETING WILL SERVE AS A CAUCUS FOR PARTICIPANTS OTHER THAN THE LICENSEE.
