Notes from RESOLVE Meetings To permit the greatest degree of open dialogue, the group agreed that notes for the RESOLVE sessions will be less formal than regular working group meetings. We will primarily document agreements and action items. RESOLVE Groundrules • • • • • •  1  Work at understanding one another. Use airtime wisely. Speak honestly and respectfully. Examine assumptions. Make tentative agreements, then look at the whole package together. One meeting review rule: we have one meeting to review and change the tentative agreements of the previous RESOLVE session.1  All agreements are tentative even after the “one meeting review rule”. However, the one meeting rule gives regular participants an opportunity to bring an agreement back to the table while assuring that tentative agreements are not forever Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Recreation Resources Working Group Page 2 of 6   • •  Document our agreements. Caucuses are okay.  Specificity Needs—Key Elements for PMEs The group discussed its desire for certain specific pieces of information to be included in each PME. These items are: 1. Timing—of plan development and implementation; 2. Priority a. Priority 1 = PME relates to safety, current need or it is needed to make everything else work; b. Priority 2 = PME is meeting an unmet need; c. Priority 3 = We really want to do this but it doesn’t fit Priorities 1 or 2. 3. Locations for action—specific sites or number of locations within the basin 4. Scope examples—Something we can agree to that tells us the scope (e.g., miles of trail, standards, facilities that already exist which are good examples of what we want to do) 5. Monitoring and triggers—how will we monitor the impacts of the action? What kind of triggers will set off additional actions (e.g., number of consecutive years of a certain level of trail usage) 6. Conflicts/synergies—with other work groups 7. Funding—information about how action will be funded 8. Goal—why are we doing the action? 9. Management Plan Issues—any topics or guidance we want to call out for inclusion in the management plan 10. Who’s involved in taking the action? 6.5.1—Provide Visitor Information (page 22 ) Goal: Provide specific visitor information services for safety and basic orientation in order to minimize natural resource impacts and help visitor enjoyment. Who’s involved in taking the action? The Recreation Subgroup of the BRCC. This subgroup may consult with other stakeholders, as they deem necessary. Locations for action: How do we inform people coming into the basin? Interests • • • • •  Give people information before they come into the basin Needs to be self service when it is not staffed Should give people a sense of entry into the Basin Provide “early on” information (e.g., “All camp grounds are full”) Provide more in depth information (e.g., safety information, environmental information)  reopened. It also accommodates regular participants who must miss a meeting and may want to weigh in on a decision. Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Recreation Resources Working Group Page 3 of 6   • • • •  Information about where to get needed passes and/or availability of passes at the location itself USFS is identified as a partner Cost effective Flexibility  Ideas for solution that respect all interests (may include one or several) • • • • •  Kiosk on route FM notification Kulshan kiosk Concrete visitors center Web information  Potential Solution 1. USFS has a likely piece of property for visitor information services. Maybe PSE can partner on it (parking lot, kiosk, plaza, potential restroom); plus 2. Concrete visitor’s center. We need to see how the USFS site would work (to determine if its scope fits in with cost interests). Monitoring: Report operations to BRCC annually; include visitor information in visitors’ survey to get feedback. Timing: Have the action put into place within five years of license acceptance. Priority: 1 Management Plan Issues: location, construction details, staffing, etc. Funding: to be determined Conflicts/synergies: Synergies exist with all groups Additional language changes: Under “Description of Action” (page 22), delete 2nd bullet (“Construct, maintain and supply a shelter for visitor informational materials at Kulshan Campground”). Under “Description of Action” (page 22), in the 1st sentence of the 4th bullet (page 22), change as follows: “Provide materials or media for Lower Baker Visitors Center, the USFS Sedro-Wolley Ranger Station, and Kulshan Visitors Shelter an entry visitor location station.” Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Recreation Resources Working Group Page 4 of 6   6.5.2: Provide Interpretive Services Goal: To encourage visitors to connect with, become knowledgeable about and respect the Baker area more by providing cooperative interpretive services. Locations: Where will these services happen? •  In areas connected to: o Wildlife observation places o Visitor information places o Lower Baker Visitor’s Center o Developed facilities  Viewpoints  Camp grounds  Trails  Day use sites  Launches  PSE Operations  • • •  We would need to evaluate which of these sites would get the most people. We would need to determine the number of interpretive displays. Services would be by multiple delivery methods, personal (2 seasonal interpreters) and nonpersonal (static displays)  Funding •  •  Sideboards for PSE cost estimate for interpretive services o ½ of one FTE for interpretive services (2 interpreters—part cost sharing) o One sign per:  Operation  Fish  Cultural  Terrestrial o Cost of plan development o Programmatic tools (e.g., mobile projector, gathering places) Note: The group members agreed to the categories, not necessarily the numbers (e.g., ½ of one FTE)  Monitoring: Annual report to BRCC Timing: Part of the Recreation Management Plan to be completed within 2 years of the License Acceptance Priority: 2 Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Recreation Resources Working Group Page 5 of 6   Management Plan Issues: needs to be flexible in addressing future needs, adaptive management, facilities, curriculum, skting, tools, programs Who does the actions? Cooperative program 6.5.3: Provide Cultural and Natural Resource and Conservation Education See Andy’s action item on page 2 of these notes. After discussion, the group decided that the best way to approach this PME was through a small working group that Andy will pull together. 2.4.1 Create trails • •  Under the 3rd bullet of “Description of Actions” (page 9), add the following sentence: “Create a nature trail with an accessible viewpoint (This feature could be satisfied by 2.5.6)” Costs for Bullet points 2-4 under “Description of Actions (pages 9 and 10), call out the dollar amounts for these trails. Add that we may look for money to go back into the RAM fund if a trail cannot be constructed.  Agenda for September 15 RESOLVE Session • • •  Agenda, note and action item review Review of revised PME’s—Andy is to revise all PME’s discussed thus far using the nine key elements for PME’s. If he is adding language, he will track those changes2 2.5—Developed Facilities  The next meeting will be held at the USFS Offices in Mountlake Terrace, Wa.  2  PME’s discussed thus far include: 2.1.1, Water Recreation Safety and Boating Hazards; 2.1.3, Law Enforcement Support; 2.4, Trails and Trailheads; 2.5.4, Kulshan Campground; 2.5.6, Wildlife Observation; 2.5.7, ADA Compliance; 6.5, Information, Education and Interpretation Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Recreation Resources Working Group Page 6 of 6    2003recreational20030811.pdf en
