Vernon PSE office Tony - Talk with Cary about Tribal representation at TRIG so he can address this in his BRICC quorum teamlet PREVIOUS – STILL RELEVANT – ACTION ITEMS All – In reviewing the TRMP land acquisition sections, consider how to list primary and secondary decision criteria. Chris & Mike D – Bring information about current land use / elk distribution to Jan. 25 Elk Teamlet meeting so we can identify areas that are good candidates for land acquisition Jacob – Coordinate with Tony & Arnie to schedule a joint ARG/TRIG meeting for Aquatic Riparian Habitat – February 1? (Alternates: February 5 or 7) Tony – Distribute the loon study/report Tony – Forward information about all potential land acquisition parcels to elk teamlet with a reminder about the need for confidentiality of all such information REPORTS ON PREVIOUS ACTION ITEMS: Baker’s Vegetation Management Plan: Tony spoke with Lou Ellyn and Lynn Bell (PSE’s Baker River maintenance supervisor) about Baker’s current and future vegetation management relevant to the BiOp process. They agreed that PSE would develop a hazard tree removal protocol in coordination with the appropriate agencies (such as the USFS, USFWS and the WDFW) as a condition of the BiOp. In the meantime, emergency tree removal will be conducted as needed. Tony shared that any planned (non-emergency) tree removal will be reviewed by an arborist or biologist pending completion of the protocol. BRICC, License Update, & BiOps Update Tony shared that most folks think we aren’t likely to see the license until April. And, if the diking districts appeal, this could add another 9 months to the process. Cary will be leading a teamlet to discuss the BRICC’s operating definition of quorum, and the next BRICC meeting will be Feb. 28. Lou Ellyn shared that the storms, holidays and sick leaves have delayed progress on the Biological Opinions, so they have extended their expected completion date to the end of February. Legal Mechanism for Filing and Reviewing/Revising the TRMP Tony shared that Cary and Connie don’t feel we need to involve PSE’s legal folks until the license is issued. His vision is that the TRMP will be a core guidance document, rather than a compilation of detailed plans. As we develop the detailed plans (ex: after land acquisition), we would send them to FERC as addendums that show we are in compliance with the requirements we describe in the TRMP. This would allow us to minimize administrative overhead since we would not be re-filing the entire TRMP Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 TRIG DRAFT Meeting Notes, January 4, 2007  Page 2 of 5   with each addition. Article 505: Aquatic Riparian Habitat Protection, Restoration, and Enhancement Plan Joint ARG/TRIG Meeting: Article 505 designates $10m (at least $1m in the Baker Basin) for the protection, restoration and enhancement of aquatic riparian habitat. Both the Aquatics and Terrestrial Groups will need to work together to prioritize the use of these funds. Jake Venard, PSE, will be coordinating the joint process. Brock, Tony, Cathy, Don, Lou Ellyn and Bob are interested in representing TRIG. Marty and Kathy will participate as needed. Jake will be meeting with the ARG next Tuesday to ask for their volunteers and will coordinate the joint meeting. Our suggestion for the first joint meeting is to start our Feb. 1 TRIG meeting with the joint meeting. If that doesn’t work for the ARG folks, we suggested Feb. 5 and 7 as alternatives. TRMP Review Tony projected the December 2005 draft of the TRMP onto a screen, renamed it January 4, 2007, and made live changes as we walked through the document chapter by chapter. We started with a discussion of the sections which state “insert final license article here,” and agreed that it is our intent to ensure that the final TRMP reflects both FERC’s license requirements and the full intent of the Settlement Agreement (SA). Unless FERC specifically disallows something in the SA, we agreed to include any “missed” SA items in the TRMP under the FERC license. We also noted the benefit of adding an “executive summary” of our intent and objectives to both the whole document (could go in section 1.4), and the introduction to each chapter to help future readers understand our intentions. These “executive summaries” could reference the article language each section refers to. Marty will ensure that each chapter follows the format Tony typed into Chapter 3: 3.0 Objectives and Requirements 3.1.1 Objectives (a high-level look at our intent / objectives within the chapter) 3.1.2 FERC Requirements (the license article) 3.1.3 Settlement Agreement Requirements (any additional SA items not covered by FERC’s article) We discussed addendums and specific implementation plans; Tony reiterated the idea that the TRMP be a core guiding document rather than the actual implementation plan. Marty noted that he and Tony need to talk with Connie about FERC’s needs/requirements around this. Chapter 2: Sections 2.3 & 2.4, Marty will look at collapsing these two and renumber the rest. Within this chapter, we noted the need to clarify how we’ll monitor implementation and effectiveness, and how we report those things to FERC. We also discussed the multiple definitions of the buzz-phrase “Adaptive Management” and asked Marty to describe our activities rather than use that particular phrase to minimize confusion. Section 2.12, within General Provisions under ESA Compliance: Marty will craft wording that states that future Implementation Plan development will include consultation with appropriate agencies (such as the Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 TRIG DRAFT Meeting Notes, January 4, 2007  Page 3 of 5   USFS, USFWS and the WDFW). Chapter 3: In addition to the edits Tony noted, Marty and Kathy will review the Pre-Acquisition Habitat Assessment section in detail since this activity has been “field tested” for the Elk Teamlet. The PreAcquisition form will be added as an addendum. Chapters 4 and Beyond: Marty will capture repeating changes (ex: topographic maps, age of trees, etc) as they show up throughout the document. We ended in the Post-Acquisition Habitat Assessment section of Chapter 4 (Elk).
