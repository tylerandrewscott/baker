AGENDA FOR JANUARY 7, 2004 MEETING 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. Baker River Project Relicense File:1-7-04_Final_Instream Flow_Notes.doc; Lyn Wiltse  1 of 5   Camelot Room, PSE Office, Bothell, WA 9:00 – 9:10 Introductions, review notes, and agenda 9:10 – 10:00 Action Items from Dec. 15 meeting 10:00 – 12:10 Review Instream Flow Proposals 12:10 – 12:30 L U N C H 12:30 – 2:30 Agreement on Constraints 2:30 – 2:45 Additional Issues? 2:45 – 3:00 Set Agenda for January 8, 2004 NEW ACTION ITEMS • Phil: Follow up with Claire re: Ruth’s additional HYDROPS runs • Phil: Follow up with Stan re; re-running his 50% and 67% incubation flow runs, based on new criteria. • Phil: Talk with Stan re: complex habitat data • Paul: Follow up with Steve re: HYDROPS capabilities REPORT ON OLD ACTION ITEMS Phil walked us through the new data generated by the action items below, referencing the corresponding files (shown in italics below- hard copies distributed at meeting, plus files emailed to all on Aquatics mail list): • R2 incorporated the results of analyzing effective spawning width accounting for only dewatering of redds into the summary figures. (Effective Chinook Spawning Width.010704.doc) • R2 sent out data summary supporting spawning suitability figure. (MSkagit Spawn suitabilityTR1-24-010503.xls) • R2 evaluated data compiled in A-09d (Middle Skagit river juvenile Salmonids) and identified the timing of alevin pre-emergence/emergence by species. • R2 accounted for why transect 12 provided more Chinook spawning habitat than chum and steelhead spawning habitat. (Spawning Suitability Transect 12.doc) • R2 ran the effective spawning analyses assuming that Baker Project releases could be maintained at 4kcfs, 6kcfs, 8kcfs, 10kcfs, 16kcfs, and 32kcfs flows during the peak Chinook spawning period of September 25 to October 31. • All reviewed the euphotic zone weighting factors as we modified them at our Dec. 15 meeting and agreed that they are fine to use going forward for Baker Lake and Lake Shannon. (Reservoir temp and zooplankton plots.010604.doc) • R2 developed a table of average monthly water temperature in the Middle Skagit River. (Skagit temp at Concrete-Historical.xls) • R2 fleshed out the flow regime diagram (monthly calendar) and sent it out so it can be discussed at the next Aquatics Resources Working Group meeting. (Instream Flow Considerations.010603.doc) BAKER RELICENSING SCHEDULE We briefly reviewed the schedule of the PDEA requirements to support the April 30 deadline. Key dates are January 16 as deadline for PSE to provide to Louis Berger the Proposed Action for use in the PDEA. January 26 is the deadline to provide Louis Berger definitive operation and Baker River Project Relicense 1-7-04_Final_Instream Flow_Notes.doc; Lyn Wiltse  Page 2 of 5   aquatic resource model runs for use in the PDEA. February 9 is the deadline for providing PME cost estimates. RESERVOIR LEVEL INTERESTS EXPRESSED Forest Service: May 23 – Sept.7: min of 724.8 ft. with .5 ft. fluctuation at Upper Baker each day; May 9 – Oct. 15: 713.8 ft. Skagit County: Oct. 15 – Mar. 1 100K acre-feet at Upper Baker and 40K acre-feet at Shannon CONSIDERATIONS FOR CREATING A MUTUALLY AGREEABLE FLOW REGIME • We want to make rational biological decisions with the water we have. • Do we establish instantaneous minimum instream flows at the Baker? • Do we monitor the Baker and the Skagit Rivers simultaneously? • Do we monitor the Baker River at the Concrete Gage? • We should consider flood control (start with existing) and ESA. • We don’t want to create spawning flows that can’t be supported during incubation (even if Nature does this?) • Instead of release on top of inflow, could we use a running average of inflow? • Try to keep all this as simple as possible (the KISS principle). • Remember Lake Shannon can act as a buffer. • Not looking for PSE to mitigate for natural hydrologic conditions; we don’t want them to make them worse. • Instead of release on top of inflow, should we use a running average of inflow? • Stan reported that the tribes need information on the relationship of complex rearing habitat and Skagit River flow and Baker release as well as off channel habitat before they can enter into discussions of an optimal flow regime. • Consider incubation flow as a percentage of spawning flow- How can we reduce spawning flows Sept. 10 through Dec. 31 while increasing flows Sept. 10 through Apr. 15?) WDFW PRELIMINARY TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR FLOWS Gary walked us through what he put together in terms of a flow regime in his response to the PDEA. After some discussion, he agreed to add 2,500 cfs as the Maximum Daily Amplitude Change (24 hours). For December, we added 2,500cfs as the Maximum Flow. These additions show up in italics in the table below: Note: We may also consider adding a Maximum Flow for March, April, and May.

During these times management of the Baker Project discharges will be through adaptive management… /4 The maximum amplitude change to be measured in the Baker River downstream of the Lower Baker powerhouse. The amplitude change is to be measured on a continuous (“rolling”) 24-hour basis, not just once per day. The maximum amplitude restriction does not apply at flows over 30,000 cfs in the Skagit River at Concrete. /5 Maximum flow until Skagit daily flows at Concrete average 20,000 cfs or greater for 7 consecutive days, then no maximum Note: Gary also included a fifth column also indicating species and life stages present by month. We agreed to run this scenario (DFW.XX) through the HYDROPS model using the elevations suggested by the Forest Service for May 23 through September 7 for sure, and May 9 through Oct. 15 if possible. We will also include the minimum water quality reservoir elevation at Lake Shannon. We agreed to rank soft constraints according to the following priority: #1 Flood Control plus Buffer at Upper Baker #2 MIF (at Baker River Gage) #3 Max. Amplitude (at Baker River Gage) #4 Ramping Guidelines #5 Baker Lake Reservoir Fluctuation from May 23 – September 7 We agreed to do the following HYDROPS runs (for all five years) overnight to review in the morning: Baker River Project Relicense 1-7-04_Final_Instream Flow_Notes.doc; Lyn Wiltse  Page 4 of 5   DFW.01: State Ramping guidelines applied on the Baker River DFW.02: State Ramping guidelines applied on the Skagit River DFW.03: “least Restrictive” Ramping guidelines (PSE proposal on ramping) HANDOUTS • Draft Meeting Notes from December 15 Instream Flows Technical Working Group • Draft Agenda for January 7 and 8 Instream Flow meetings • Baker Relicense Project – Milestone Dates, December 19, 2003 • Effective Chinook Spawning Width.010704.doc • MSkagit Spawn suitabilityTR1-24-010503.xls • Spawning Suitability Transect 12.doc • FlowReleasesDuringPeakChinookSpawning.doc • Reservoir temp and zooplankton plots.010604.doc • Skagit temp at Concrete-Historical.xls • Instream Flow Considerations.010603.doc • Excerpt from WDFW 02 January 2004 letter to the FERC presenting their preliminary terms and conditions for the Baker Rive Hydroelectric Project (Flows/Discharges) DRAFT AGENDA FOR JANUARY 8, 2004 MEETING 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. USFS Building in Mountlake Terrace, WA 9:00 – 9:10 Introductions, review notes, and agenda 9:10 – 9:30 Action Items from January 7 meeting 9:30 – 11:00 Review Output from HYDROPS runs: • DFW.01: State Ramping guidelines applied on the Baker River • DFW.02: State Ramping guidelines applied on the Skagit River • DFW.03: “least Restrictive” Ramping guidelines (PSE proposal on ramping) 11:00 – 11:30 Other Issues: • Scott Schuyler: Upper Skagit Proposal 11:30 – Noon Other Issues: • Arn Thoreen? • Protocol for on/off cycle test next week? 12:00 – 12:30 L U N C H 12:30 – 12:45 Review data on incubation flow as percentage of spawning flow 12:45 – 2:00 Identify other runs/regimes 2:00 – 2:30 Other Issues? 2:30 – 2:45 Identify next steps 2:45 – 3:00 Set Agenda for January 23 RESOLVE Meeting  Baker River Project Relicense 1-7-04_Final_Instream Flow_Notes.doc; Lyn Wiltse  Page 5 of 5    2004instream20040107.pdf en
