REPORT ON PAST ACTION ITEMS · ALL: Reviewed initial spread sheet for T-4 and note which species exist in the Basin or in the area effected by the project. (If you know it’s there put “y”’ for yes or “n” for no with your initials by it. Leave blank if you don’t know. Add any species present in the area but not on the list.) · Lauri: Drafted study request for BBS. · Ann: Drafted study request for RT-16. · Tom: Review T-17 protocol with Fred Seavey re: next steps. · Tony: Contacted Stan, Fred, Steve, and Gary re: finalized study plans from today.

BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 8/21/2001 MEETING NOTES Page 2 of 6 L Wiltse for Terrestrial Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150 RESERVOIR FLUCTUATION ZONE – RELATED STUDIES Tony reported that studies in the drawdown zone will have to be conducted in spring of 2002 since reservoir levels have remained high through the summer. STATUS OF: R-T5: Wetland Inventory Study This plan was approved with some additional edits. The next version will be the “Working Group Approved Final Study Plan”. R-T16: Project Area Rare Plant Survey Ann explained that the intent is to apply to National Forest and other lands. This study uses Forest Service protocols and lists of species from Forest Service and Natural Heritage. Level 2 and Level 5 surveys are proposed. Descriptions of these levels, along with the lists of the botanical species of concern were included in an addendum to this study. There was discussion re: the scope of the study. Ann will reassess the areas that would be surveyed – specifically, how much of suitable habitat would be surveyed, based on potential/current project impacts. Are Level 2 surveys needed? What are the Forest Service NEPA requirements? R-T2: Vegetation Mapping in Project Area Tom distributed a progress report of the work being done on this study, which began on July 17 and is expected to conclude by summer 2002. (See attached). R-T15: Basin Vegetation Mapping Joetta is awaiting a couple more data sets from Crown Pacific/DNR. When she gets those we will convene a Technical Work Group to review the plots and determine next steps (decide which database to use). Looking at October time frame. RT 18: Breeding Bird Survey Lauri shared with the group references for protocols. This methodology is based on singing adult males. It wouldn’t cover the drawdown zone, e.g. waterfowl, shorebirds, waders etc. Perhaps we should use this survey to get baseline data on abundance and distribution. Maybe we should modify Partners in Flight protocol – to do variable circular plots to get densities. Bob suggested we add a vegetation protocol to get at structural data often missed by plant surveys. We may want to cover “project vicinity” (beyond project area.). Lauri’s intention with this survey is for developing baseline information for potential PM&E discussion/measures. She will re-work this draft and we will review it in September. LAND USE: The Recreation Working Group will take the lead on land use. Much of that information will be relevant to studies/recommendations this Working Group makes.
