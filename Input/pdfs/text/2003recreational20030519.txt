DISPERSED RECREATION: Patrick presented suggested wording to PME 2.2.2. The wording discusses the possibility - in future - of having to manage project related dispersed sites if they have impact on specific surrounding wilderness areas. Dee suggested this be included in PME RESOLVE discussions over the coming months. DEBRIEF OF MAY 14 WORKSHOP Andy reviewed what happened at the 5/14 Cross Resource Workshop. He gave out the PDEA feedback given by the Berger group at that workshop. We agreed that we would not be able to provide additional detail before June 1, 2003. We agreed, however, that we would get started on RESOLVE discussions. Dee presented a draft process for settlement that's being worked on by Solution Team. People raised Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Recreation Resources Working Group   questions about the Policy Team. All agreed that we'd like to come to as much agreement as possible within the working group & at the Solution Team level. We agreed to hold RESOLVE discussions on the following days: (9am - 3pm) June 16 (Mt. Vernon) July 21 (Mountlake Terrace) August 11 (Mountlake Terrace) For the June 16 RESOLVE meeting, we put the following topics on the agenda: 2.1.1 Water Safety 2.1.2 Boating hazards 2.4.1 Create new trails 2.5.4 Kulshan 2.5.7 ADA compliance AESTHETICS STUDY (TEAMLET REPORT) Andy reported on teamlet meeting to select photos for Focus Group sessions. The teamlet, instead, had discussion about expansion of study scope, to include not only VQO (Visual Quality Objectives) but also SMS (Scenery Management System) method of USFS, and to expand geographical area of study. They did not reach a conclusion. Ann explained what SMS is and why it's important to USFS. In Forest Service philosophy, historically, they hadn't looked at ecological impacts. Now they do. Not only does something need to look appropriate, it needs to be ecologically sound. Things also need to feel appropriate in cultural/social context. PSE Interests <b7> Need to get study done this summer. <b7> Study needs to draw light over the area of project effect, as opposed to a broader view. <b7> Cost of study needs to be reasonable. <b7> Study results do not create expectations that PSE will "mitigate the world" Forest Service Interests <b7> Use SMS as part of study based on USFS policy. <b7> Want study right sized to scope. <b7> Results should be useful to guide other PME's (e.g. lake levels, vegetation. management, etc.) Skagit County Interests <b7> Shannon Lake area is covered. <b7> Whatever is done will blend with environment. <b7> Ecologically sound. How can we design & implement a study that respects all interests? <b7> Find out how much more money it will cost. <b7> Conduct high level study now & expand on it later. <b7> Do Phase I now to satisfy FERC but in a way that will be useful at next step. <b7> Project effects, operations in terms of VQO. Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Recreation Resources Working Group   STUDY UPDATE: We discussed how to best review and provide feedback on studies. We decided to review and discuss at next meeting: R11/15 R12: SITE INVENTORY In July, we would look at R16.
