We will provide Web-Ex capability for these meetings to facilitate remote attendance. PSE LEGAL OPINION ON USE OF RAM FUNDS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT Cary reported that he received an opinion from PSE attorneys that there is no prohibition in Settlement Agreement Article 602 –Required Funding (RAM funds) for the use of funds for law enforcement because it is within the scope of recreation management resources identified in the article. Therefore the 602 RAM funding could be allocated accordingly by the RRG. He encouraged members to have their own attorneys review the article for their concurrence with PSE attorneys. OVERVIEW OF DECISION MAKING PROTOCOL Cary briefly reviewed the quorum rule and the decision making protocol according to the SA Article 601 to ensure a common understanding and execution of that protocol. With the tribe voting present and abstaining, (proxy vote related to Pam), it was agreed that we have the quorum required to take a vote in the event that we are unable to reach consensus on the decisions on the agenda for this meeting. The proponent of the decision item could call for the vote to be taken. After discussing the vote and the reasons the voting parties voted the way they did, we could, if desired by the proponent, take a second vote. At that time, if we still lacked consensus, the proponent would have the option to elevate the proposal to the BRCC where the decision would be taken. A BRCC decision for Article 602 requires some preparation and notifications, but could change to a majority rule vote on some actions per SA 601. FOREST SERVICE PROPOSAL Ann explained that the USFS sent out some additional detail about the spending on Article 303 – specifically what would constitute full funding vs. enhancement for the Baker Lake Resort Redevelopment. She explained that they also intend to resubmit their original request for the $50K of the Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 RRG Final Meeting Notes February 26, 2010 Page 1 of 7 2010 funds available in Article 602 (RAM Funding). Therefore, the USFS total request would be for $100K. They deferred the vote on $50K of the funds to be taken at the April RRG meeting. Ann also explained that the Forest Service is hoping that these decisions not get made until the process agreed on at the meetings takes place. We are hoping that some additional funding (other than the RAM funding) will be freed up for law enforcement proposals after the 30 day review of the completed Law Enforcement Plan (LEP) is complete. The USFS hopes this might occur as early as the next RRG on April 20. These law enforcement funds (SA 318 and Appendix A-5) generally provide approximately $95K for law enforcement annually. While the idea is to use the collaborative process to guide these funding decisions, the reality is that PSE can use funds designated to them (~$22K/yr) to achieve law enforcement actions, and USFS use the $73K/yr designated to them for similar purposes per the LEP. Art 303 (Baker Lake Resort Redevelopment Plan) had $91K funding for year one after license issuance. The known planning costs, to that date, were $30K and so that portion of the $91k was held back from the funding to the USFS. The USFS received the remaining $61,526. Once all of the planning and decommissioning was completed, those remaining costs were removed from the available funding and the year two funding was accelerated to year one payment to the USFS. A total of $586,004 remained to complete the work required in SA 303, for which they had produced an engineering estimate (attached spreadsheet). However, the estimate, may not take in all considerations that a contractor would have. The USFS should have bids back by mid April in time for the April RRG meeting. Cary pointed out that in order to fulfill the requirements for spending RAM (Recreation Adaptive Management) funds, it will be necessary to specify what those funds are spent on. The USFS spreadsheet had the project features broken into phases, the SA303 completion in white, Phase 1 option of additional features proposed to be purchased with SA 602 funding in green (~$52K) , Phase 2 options proposed from SA 602 funding in orange (~$48K), and Phase 3 options proposed from SA 602 funding in blue (~$65K) . DECISIONS 1. “Shall the Recreation Resource Group (RRG) distribute $50K (2006 dollars) RAM funds to the USDA-FS for the Baker Lake Resort Redevelopment?” Consensus was YES. It was noted that the funds were projected to go toward solar security lighting phase 1 and picnic shelter (see attached spreadsheet). 2. “Shall the Recreation Resource Group (RRG) distribute $11K (2006 dollars) RAM funds to Whatcom County Sheriff’s Office for the purchase of equipment, listed in proposal dated December 10, 2009 (revised on February 22, 2010), requested by PSE on behalf of Whatcom County represented by Deputy Jeff Turner” There was no consensus. Pam (PSE) then called for a vote.

Brock decided to defer the vote. He will re-submit the proposal at a later date. On this action the items for action were completed and call ended.
