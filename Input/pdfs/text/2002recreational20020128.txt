Evaluate meeting  NEW ACTION ITEMS  <b7> ALL: Consider 2002 field data requirements.  <b7> ALL: Review Parking Lot.  <b7> Lauri Let Chris know if WDFW Mill Creek Office can do conference calling.  <b7> Chris: Let Andy know he can stop tending to the traffic monitoring equipment (`til spring).  <b7> Chris: Talk with Arnie and Nick re: Aquatics GIS layers.  <b7> Chris: Ask R2 to put selected reservoir points on the draft viewshed map.  <b7> Chris: Secure contact from Whatcom and Skagit Counties.  <b7> Tony: Get update on PSE/Dept. of Ecology water quality study.  <b7> Tony: Give real estate update.  <b7> Chris: Distribute angler survey/creel census data compiled by Ann to team members.  <b7> Tony: Send out 2001 list of accomplishments to Ann and Ardis.  <b7> Chris Review USFS Watershed Analysis for information on resident native fish  populations/historic data.  <b7> Ann:  Talk with Brady re: quality of fishery.  <b7> Jim:  Send Chris draft SCORP document (Board Review Draft of SCORP update, including  analysis of statewide survey of 15 different activity areas) so Chris can send out to team members.  <b7> Tony Contact Susan Hada re: 866 phone capability at FS building at Mountlake Terrace.  <b7> Andy: Give staffing update for possible ongoing monitoring (spring) of developed/dispersed sites.  <b7> Chris: Meet with Ann (Ardis/Jim as backups) re: integrating market analysis into needs analysis.  <b7> Chris: Get with Ardis, Jim, Susan and Ann re: formulating survey data queries.  REPORT ON OLD ACTION ITEMS <b7> Chris: Discussed '97 versus 2000 versions of Access database. We will be using '97 for our database. <b7> Chris: Provided input re: tweaking study index to show status /start/end dates, etc. <b7> Chris: Brought initial interest list from first Public Meeting (April 26, 2000). We added this to the Parking Lot for future consideration. <b7> Chris: Created initial draft of Needs Analysis study plan (look at items from R-1 and R-2). <b7> Andy: Forwarded email on "Baker Lake Trail Run" to Ann. <b7> Andy: Investigated condition of traffic counter on Road 1107. We agreed to remove the traffic counters for now and reinstall them in the spring, due to lost data and need for frequent   attention associated with snow and plowing. <b7> Tony: Research ownership of dispersed recreation sites around Lake Shannon. Tony is still in the process of researching real estate ownership around Lake Shannon (particularly around boat ramp and the Concrete area). <b7> Ann: Chased down fish data from Brady (trout, etc.). Tony and Chris shared report that the WDFW representatives at the last Baker River Committee indicated WDFW wasn't able to make a decision re: stocking of Baker Lake with non-native fish (trout). The outcome of the meeting was that rainbow trout would not be stocked in Baker Lake this year. WDFW may develop a program for stocking trout in Depression Lake. They will keep us posted. <b7> Lauri: Checked with Gary re: Aquatic Working Group data we need. <b7> Lauri: Reserved WDFW office at Mill Creek for our February 25, meeting. She will check on availability of conference phone capability. HANDOUTS <b7> 2001 Licensing Accomplishments (Baker River Project FERC No. 2150) EXISTING STUDIES UPDATE R9 RECREATION USE SURVEY <ad> ELECTRONIC MONITORING The short-term status of this program (use of temporary counters) is discussed under the action items. Chris reported that the National Park Service counter system at Denali National Park would not be a model we can adopt, because that system has AC power to one station plus several temporary stations run on batteries. We still have been unable to identify a feasible power source we can use on a long-term basis. Chris will continue to research this. R7 +R8 = R14: SECONDARY DATA COLLECTION Chris reported we are moving ahead with this. He will continue to update us. Jim reported that participation in outdoor activities is down from previous years. He'll send those data to Chris for our review. R12 DEVELOPED AND DISPERSED SITE INVENTORY and R13 RECREATION VISITOR SURVEYS Since late November, we have been working on entering these data into Access databases. By about December 10, Nancy Smaridge had entered all data from the dispersed site inventory. We are checking the data and should be able to do database queries shortly. As of about a week ago, she finished entering the recreation use/activity observations from the visitor survey study. Responses from all visitor interviews and drop box surveys are being processed and analyzed by a research firm in Bellevue. We should have these data in the next couple of weeks. We will need to determine what things we want to cross-tabulate to assist us with our second stage survey analysis. Chris will meet with a teamlet to propose how we do this. STUDY REQUESTS/PENDING STUDY PLANS R11: RECREATION CAPACITY AND SUITABILITY ANALYSIS Jim suggested we use the general participation categories used in the SCORP document as a framework in   determining "suitability for what?" in this study. He listed the 14 categories we would use. These categories are broad and inclusive. They have been broken out into 157 sub-activities (e.g., breakdown for hiking was urban, rural, mountain/forest, and no established trails). We agreed to review these when we receive it from Jim. The latest draft of the Study Plan was sent out November 15. Chris hasn't received any additional review comments. We agreed to approve this Study Plan. NOTE: The plan may change based on the Needs Analysis. R16: NEEDS ANALYSIS and R-15: TRAIL ROUTING The group agreed to approve the R15 Study Plan with the edit of combining Task 2 with Task 4 and moving it before Task 3. The R16 Study Plan was sent out last week. We discussed the plan and how we might actually conduct the market analysis task. Ann and Chris will look at this offline (with backup from Jim and Ardis). Jim reported that he felt we could get these data from our capacity and suitability analysis. We will also keep in mind trends/ changes in demographic data and public taste in activities. It will be helpful to this group to use the Charles Howard Hydro Operations Model to run through various scenarios (e.g., ramping rates, etc.), as determined by NMFS, Fish &Wildlife and PSE in the Interim Protection Plan, which will be treated as the baseline project operation. The model will help us determine recreational impacts. Chris will integrate the R16 study plan changes suggested by Lauri into the November 15 draft and send out the revised version for all to review. We should be prepared to approve this request at our February meeting. PARKING LOT - Operationally define "project induced" - List authorities that this team must be aware of - Tie education piece to ALL Working Groups - Hold periodic "outreach" meetings for feedback from other groups (hiking, horseback riding, etc.) - Land Management - Forest Service presentation of SMS - Trailhead surveys - Have demonstration of Charles Howard Operational Model (this winter?) - SOP (sense of place) presentation (Jim) - Refer to April 26, 2000 Interest List.
