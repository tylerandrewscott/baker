FISH PASSAGE TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP REPORT The Baker Net Replacement Field Schedule for 2004 was stated. The launching of the Net Transition Structure is scheduled for first thing in the morning on February 18. The net will be assembled at the Baker Project, February 23-March 22. Its deployment is scheduled for March 23-26. This team is continuing to meet two days a month. On the first day they address issues of technical design. On the second day they discuss issues related to settlement (e.g., performance standards and testing methods). Their next meeting will be March 8 and 9th up at the Baker River Lodge. Phase 1 of the Floating Surface Collector (500 cfs) is scheduled to be complete in early 2007. A design memo on this will be out by the end of the February. Modification of upstream adult passage will begin in 2008. Stress relief ponds are also part of what is being planned for the downstream passage system. LOWER BAKER TURBINE CONFIGURATION & MEETING RAMPING RATE CRITERIA Joel Molander, Hydro Asset Manager for PSE explained that in 1965 there were three units at lower Baker. Two of the units at the Lower Baker Powerhouse, each unit being fed by two penstocks, were taken out in the landslide of 1965, and only Unit 3 was returned to service. The other units remain buried to this day. The roof of the new power house is built into the rock wall behind it, extremely sloped and built to withstand several tons of weight (in anticipation of another slide). There is a similar slide risk downstream of the powerhouse. After careful consideration, potential powerhouse expansion is most feasible to the north. They are also looking at possibly resurrecting the 1920 penstocks daylighted from the original powerhouse. Unit #3 is a vertical Francis unit. These units come with serious cavitation issues. Other challenges lie with a history of operating with a stepped ramp function, and if that will be allowed going forward, given ramping guidelines. Engineering estimates to expand to two additional units came in at between $40-45 million. These additional limits would allow for 7,100 cfs hydraulic capacity. The current water right at Lower Baker is only 6,000 cfs. Joel reported that there would be no incremental energy benefit associated with the increased generation capacity. PSE is now looking at other options, including making modifications to the existing unit and adding a smaller single unit, at 680-750 cfs. The estimate for doing this is $17 million. The goal is to provide a broader range of operation, while minimizing collateral damage. The option of adding only a single unit carries with it increased costs of maintenance, and also periodic replacement of the unit. Joel emphasized that these costs are part of what will be necessary in order to meet State Ramping requirements. PSE plans to be able to ramp through 1000-3,000 cfs. This does not mean they will be able to operate at a steady state within this zone. Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Aquatics Resources Instream Flows/Working Group/RESOLVE Session February 12, 2004 Page 3 of 7 Folks appreciated Joel’s explanation of the possible Lower Baker turbine configurations. We will work to come up with a flow regime that works for all interests. INSTREAM FLOW TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP Phil distributed an updated Summary Comparison Table and walked us though the changes. Revisions were made to PSE.02 making it PSE.02(R) for the PDEA: Removal of terrestrial reservoir levels at Upper and Lower Baker; addition of Forest Service summer recreation reservoir levels; and increased critical flows from 18 to 30,000cfs. The other revision was to SSC.21 to show the average for all five years updated with new powerhouse configuration to include maximum generation of 7100 cfs. Newly created runs shown were DFW.06 and NMF.02. Lake levels relative to water quality were set at Upper and Lower Baker. NMF.01 was found to be infeasible due to the maximum cfs capacity during spawning periods and violations of water quality standards. For NMF.02, Irena relaxed the recreation levels down to water quality level. Level 2 post processing is underway for this run. Economics - Paul explained the two new rows we added to this section of the table. Note: Row four should read: Annual Dependable Capacity Replacement (x $1million). Hydrologics - On the Row 2, the volume was added. On the Last Row the average duration in days was added. On the Reservoir Row he added the euphotic zone volume, with numbers expressed as a percentage of the PSE.01 volume numbers. Ramping - Many of the blanks in the Ramping Rows have been filled in (happy to have Stuart back from vacation). Spawning - We can keep spawning flows low if we relax many other parameters. If we won’t make it, we need to choose whether we want to allow high flows to come through for a short period of time, or allow medium flows to come through over a longer period. We agreed that we’d like to emulate the natural freshet process as much as possible. We need a spawning /incubation index that all feel comfortable with for comparison purposes. We also agreed that Chinook is a priority species. Luckily, they spawn deeper than other species. We also want to stay in hydrologic control. Challenges we face include how to protect the most fish, over the full range of hydrologic conditions, recognizing that diversity is also important, within. We also have structural limitations. Summarize Action/Decision Items We know we want lower spawning flows and incubation flows of at least 1,000 cfs when there is enough water. The question is: How much can we do with only one additional turbine? Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Aquatics Resources Instream Flows/Working Group/RESOLVE Session February 12, 2004 Page 4 of 7 Paul will coordinate a conference call with Steve, Gary, Stan, and Ruth on Feb. 18th from 2:00 to 3:00. He will send out the dial-in number so other interested folks can also participate. At our February 27, Instream Flow Meeting, we’ll discuss: • -Review revised Suumary Comparison Table • -Review HYDROPS output for latest runs • -Take stock of where we are • -Define where we want to be RESOLVE: DRAFT PROPOSED ACTIONS 3.1.1 Provide Fish Propagation & Enhancement Stan and Gary have expressed concern with numbers, schedule, and methodology. Gary is also concerned about reduction of current programs and resident trout. Stan and Gary are working on some revisions to this PME. Steve reminded us of the context – in FERC proceedings, sometimes people end up requesting mitigation several times for a single impact - which ends up delaying the process as it is sorted out. What is Puget’s responsibility here? We also have a water supply problem. Finally, going beyond a 20,000 pounds instantaneous capacity, the footprint would need to expand. We also need to come to terms with the adult holding space. Doreen also expressed concern re: how FERC would look at this. 3.4.1 Implement Fluvial Geomorphic Management Stan voiced concerns about the PME lacking a dollar amount and what trigger mechanism would be used. He will work to develop language in these areas. Gary raised concern that PME’s all refer to BRCC when it should, in some cases, more specifically refer to Aquatic Resource Working Group. Arnie will review this. 3.4.3 Shoreline Erosion Management The USFS wants to amend its language on this PME. They also believe the amount of dollars isn’t sufficient. The latter is a policy level discussion. 3.4.4 Aquatic Habitat Restoration The USFS believes that it needs to start negotiations at 20 million dollars. This also needs to be discussed at the policy level. 3.4.1 Large Woody Debris Stan noted the rationale language is different from what he’d read before. He asked where it came from. Some folks disagree with it as it’s currently written. Arnie will investigate this and we will discuss this at our next meeting. STUDY UPDATES A01/a/b/A26b: Reservoir Tributary Study: Draft Report This report has been out since November. Arnie will distribute a list of Forest Service concerns to members for discussion at our March ARWG meeting. A16: Lower Baker River Alluvial Fan Assessment Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Aquatics Resources Instream Flows/Working Group/RESOLVE Session February 12, 2004 Page 5 of 7 Stan and Devin provided comments on this assessment January 27. They included also the Little Baker Project. Their question: Could Baker Project water releases be timed to coincide with high flows in the Skagit River to minimize scour, yet still maintain flood protection? The hope is this would restore spawning habitat downstream. A25: Project Influenced Predation Study: Draft Report Unnatural predation- Carl Hadley of Cedarock Consulting walked us through the scope and findings of the study, as summarized in the draft report, the major predator was Char. There was not much habituation observed. Predation rates seemed comparable to what occurs in natural systems. We’ll discuss this at our next meeting. A26a: Reservoir Production Potential Draft Report Michele McGrady provided a brief summary of the report findings: 1)Baker Lake does not appear to be nutrient limited at the present stocking densities, 2) fertilization is not recommended, 3) the system is below carrying capacity for sockeye, 4) age distribution is similar to Alaska sockeye systems and independent ADFW scale analysis supports this 5) continued age and water quality/zooplankton monitoring is recommended with some change to sampling protocol suggested, and 6) incremental approach to increasing sockeye fry production is recommended. The revised draft report was sent out for review. All were asked to get their comments to Arnie by February 28 for discussion at our March 11 meeting.
