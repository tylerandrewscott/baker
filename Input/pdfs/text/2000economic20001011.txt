Review/revise minutes and agenda Action items Continue fleshing out Issues/Interests Set agenda for next meeting, November 8, 2000 Evaluate meeting  BOB HELTON’S SUGGESTIONS FOR PSE: 1. After reading ‘97, ‘98, & ‘99 PSE Annual Reports, noted there is no (direct) mention of environmental/ fishery good works or who was in charge of same. 2. Looked at April, 2000 list of concerns and wish list of probable/possible mitigation areas (unprioritized). 3. The ALP is going to go for next 50 years (from 2004 onward) and who knows or who can predict what the real needs are 20 years from now if sooner or later. 4. New research and findings from other ALPs/power generators may hold clues for no cost at all. Therefore, the best we can do right now is to prioritize present concerns and propose solutions; but how do we pay for mitigation efforts (agreed upon by who and when do we start saving for improvements if really needed using the current baseline of knowledge?) An overall solution may be as follows: PSE needs to create an Environmental Ombudsman that can operate as the “Corporate Conscience” for the relicensing period (next 50 years). a. The ombudsman works with interested private, governmental groups and they vote on what happens over 10-year periods, for example. b. Funding to carry out projects comes from 1% of net profits into a corporate “Lock Box Fund”. (maybe more than 1%, but this depends on PSE management attitude). c. Salary of Ombudsman comes out of fund and all interested parties for proposed mitigation activities are voluntary by government agencies, private groups/parties. d. One possible allowed use of accumulated fund/pot could be for dam removal if it comes to that. Advantages of this process are: 1. PSE and interested parties only work on prioritized projects as accumulated funding permits. 2. If Ombudsman function is set up right it could receive donations from non-PSE sources to carry on good works. 3. Now evolving priorities can move to top of list as licensing procedure proceeds. 4. PSE can claim to be “honestly green” and public/groups have a point of contact to work with and keep track of progress. 5. Everybody wins to limit of acceptable rate of funding %/year by PSE plus donations.
