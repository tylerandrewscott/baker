Evaluate meeting ARMY CONTROL OF ENGINEERS FLOOD CONTROL PRESENTATION Wayne Wagner opened by explaining the integral relationship the Corps has with PSE for providing flood control. His presentation addressed these four areas: • Why flood control? • How dams are managed for flood control • Effects of flood control • Where are we going? His presentation will be made available on the Baker River Project Website. A question was brought up after the presentation regarding the potentially competing interests of flood control and the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Wayne explained that the federal agencies have been able to work together to achieve this important balance. In the event that the agencies were ever unable to BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 11/8/2000 MEETING NOTES Page 2 L Wiltse for Economics/Operations Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150 come to consensus on how to achieve both objectives, it may have to be resolved by The Justice Dept. or executive level. The Corps’ interest is to minimize the federal costs of flood control. HYDRO 101 PRESENTATION BY BOB BARNES Bob Barnes gave a “Hydrology 101” presentation covering the natural hydrology of the watershed, the physical characteristics of the reservoirs, how and why they are operated the way they are, a brief review of market factors affecting project operation, a review of historical and current reservoir operations.
