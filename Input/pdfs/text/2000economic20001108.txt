Wayne: Email a copy of his presentation to Kevin so it can be posted on the website. Paul: Bring Town of Concrete's Waste Water Comprehensive Plan Kevin: Contact BPA/Western Systems Coordinating Council re: their participation on this team Bob: Email copies of presentation overheads along with his speaking notes to working group members Charles: To give significant outage dates to Bob. ALL: Review interests and issues, making sure that your group is included.

Charles provided the following breakdown: <b7> Lower Baker: Public roads are County at Lower Baker. Private roads within the operating project (not open to Public) are maintained by PSE. <b7> Upper Baker: USFS road 1130 bisects the Upper Baker project (East-West direction) property. USFS maintains this road except over the top of the dam. <b7> Boat Launch Access Road: This road begins near the public restrooms and runs North to boat launch. It is open to public, and surfaced/PSE maintained. <b7> Road to Glover Mountain: Gravel road, open to public . PSE maintained. <b7> Kulshan Campground access roads: Gravel, open to public, PSE maintained.  Kevin distributed a plant assessment spreadsheet of costs done by Raytheon. These costs are for replacement /refurbishment of plant equipment, based on estimated remaining useful life. No fish or dam costs are included. Kevin will see what information he can pull together related to present costs and values of operations.  AGENDA November 8, 2000 at PSE Office in Mt. Vernon, WA 1. Review/revise minutes and agenda 2. Action items 3. Finish up issues/interests? 4. Hydro 101 Presentation by Bob Barnes 5. Presentation on Flood Control? 6. Set agenda for next meeting 7. Evaluate meeting  ARMY CONTROL OF ENGINEERS FLOOD CONTROL PRESENTATION Wayne Wagner opened by explaining the integral relationship the Corps has with PSE for providing flood control. His presentation addressed these four areas: <b7> Why flood control? <b7> How dams are managed for flood control <b7> Effects of flood control <b7> Where are we going?  His presentation will be made available on the Baker River Project Website.  A question was brought up after the presentation regarding the potentially competing interests of flood control and the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Wayne explained that the federal agencies have been able to work together to achieve this important balance. In the event that the agencies were ever unable to  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 11/8/2000 MEETING NOTES L Wiltse for Economics/Operations Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 2   come to consensus on how to achieve both objectives, it may have to be resolved by The Justice Dept. or executive level. The Corps' interest is to minimize the federal costs of flood control. HYDRO 101 PRESENTATION BY BOB BARNES Bob Barnes gave a "Hydrology 101" presentation covering the natural hydrology of the watershed, the physical characteristics of the reservoirs, how and why they are operated the way they are, a brief review of market factors affecting project operation, a review of historical and current reservoir operations. He closed with a discussion of some of the operational consequences of the reservoirs on other stakeholder interests.
