Set priorities and Action Items 4. Set next agenda--Is facilitation needed?  NEW ACTION ITEMS Paul: Send out sample scenarios (proposed base-case) run and results. Paul: Update TST diagram and distribute to teamlet members.  Baker River Project Relicense Technical Scenario Teamlet File:4-9-03 Final Draft TST notes.doc; Lyn Wiltse  1 of 3   ALL: Review HYDROPS request form on PSE website. ALL: Send suggestions for Input/Output package to Paul by April 14. Paul: Create a draft template of inputs/outputs and send to teamlet members to review prior to our next meeting (April 17 from 10:00 to noon). Lloyd: Send to Paul HYDROPS technical information/articles to distribute to teamlet members.  REVIEW DRAFT MEMORANDUM-DETERMINE TEAMLET FUNCTION Paul sent out a memo in response to a request from the Aquatics Working Group outlining the functions of the TST. He proposed the main functions be:  1. Standardize and document modeling definitions and assumptions. 2. Define and standardize model input and output formats. 3. Provide QA/QC on analysis requests and modeling output. 4. Coordinate modeling requests so that analyses are reduced. 5. Maintain a database of analysis results. 6. Standardize methods of communication with Working Groups. (added 4/9/03) 7. Initiate simulation requests. (added 4/9/03)  Scott suggested we ensure that we provide interpretations along with results of model runs. These would take into account integrating different resource concerns.  Ruth suggested that we track specific requirements that are developed in each of the Resource Working Groups. The format for doing this <ad> which would allow others to participate in the analysis.  Under #2, (see above). For in input/ out put formats, it would be nice to include graphical scales to allow for overlays.  Under #4, (see above). Check with initiators to be sure the intent is not lost when morphing studies together.  Where would the analysis/synthesis be done? We would provide the format for doing this which would allow others to participate in the analysis. We would be informing the negotiations, but not where the negotiations take place.  Do we generate our own requests or simply react to requests of others? The consensus was that we do both.  There will likely be back and forth between this group and the individual Working Groups. We will probably ask for additional input or scenario runs based on preliminary findings from initial runs (interests, commonalities, etc.)  We need a standardized way for us to communicate back to the Working Groups the results. We would be providing analysis/synthesis functions in addition to the technical output of the runs. We would actively solicit feedback and post results on the PSE website. We could also take requests from the Solution Team.
