In order for the team to successfully accomplish its mission, it was suggested that the following entities participate: USGS (as a resource) Skagit River Watershed Council/Planning Natural Resource Conservation Service Forest Concerns for the Upper Skagit Skagit Fisheries Enhancement Group Land Trust Town of Concrete Dept. of Natural Resources (Aquatic) Corps of Engineers NMFS Seattle City Light USFWS County (including beneficiaries of flood protection) American Rivers MEETING NORMS The team added an additional norm to its list of norms. Changes are bolded. They will continue to revise this list over time so it suits the needs of the team:  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 3   25. At end of each meeting, we will always review agenda and assign a person to call contact resource person and debrief/preview topics they would be interested in. ISSUES/INTERESTS The team reviewed the list of issues developed at the April 26 Overview Team Meeting and added to the list they began to generate at the June meeting: Interests • Protection, preservation, perpetuation, of fish and wildlife in their natural habitat • Fish don’t get stranded • Economic viability • Flood control • Fulfilling legal mandates (CWA, CZMA, FPA) • Combo of CWA and CZMA, FPA, and ESA, FWCA, Forest and Park, … • Impacts on terrestrial, water quality, aquatic resources, and recreational resources • Loss of spawning habitat • Loss of access to tributaries • Loss of habitat • Protection of life and property • Consequences of operating the reservoir to provide flood protection • Loss of natural stream processes • Protection of existing water rights • Time constraints- I might be left out of the process • Town of Concrete and Skagit Valley municipalities meeting financial and legal responsibilities • Potential loss of cultural, recreational, and natural resources • Drinking water quality • Possible conflicting outcomes due to multiple simultaneous processes external to re-licensing. Issues • Lake productivity, limnology • Minimum flows • Marine derived nutrients • Ramping rates • Relationship between flood control and water level manipulations for (reservoir) impoundments (ecological considerations) • Erosion • Recreational considerations • Fish migration (upstream and down) • Water releases for restoration projects • Impacts of operation on water flow (moved to issues, from interests) • Potential contaminant sources in basin for snow chemistry, air pollution, recreation impacts to water quality. • Parameter Effects (pH, etc.) • Impacts on water quality BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 4   • •  • Impacts of reservoir operations Watershed discharge rate (peak and low flow) • From land use • Impacts water quality Impacts of glacial flux on flow and water quality relationships to project operations  There were concerns raised regarding the structure (or lack thereof) to be used for identifying interests and issues and how they will be used. It was also suggested that the working groups set their own decision-making methodology. There was also a concern re: time frame for PSE request of FERC for the Alternative Licensing Process (ALP). PARKING LOT • Communication Plan to enlist “reluctant” members • Reservoir/watershed: • “Hydrology 101” • Project description EVALUATION OF MEETING Well Dones: - Stuck to agenda - Good treats - Facilitation of shift in focus/direction of discussion - Time spent on process Opportunities to Improve: - Lyn should pause to allow team members time to collect their thoughts - Started and ended 12 minutes late - Missing half and half for coffee - Spent too much time discussing tour an not enough time on issues/interests - Spent too much time discussing process TENTATIVE AGENDA FOR NEXT MEETING September 14, 2000 Agenda 9:30 - 12:30 PSE Office in Mt.
