Tony stated that the current license has two articles relating to dam access. Article 31 says PSE is to build a road across the dam. Article 35 grants the Forest Service public access to all project roads that the Forest Service deems to be of public interest. PSE has no requirement for a road across the river at the upper end of the lake. <b7> ALL: Gave preferred method of being contacted on "SNOW DAYS" (i.e., regarding any weatherbased changes in meeting plans) to Tony.  January 22, 2000 Agenda 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. at PSE Office in Mt. Vernon 1. Review/revise minutes/agenda 2. Review Action Items 3. Flood Control Presentation---Wayne Wagner 4. Continue defining studies <b7> Review study request form <b7> Define near term 2001 studies <b7> Address subsequent study needs 5. Set agenda for Feb. 26 meeting 6. Evaluate meeting STUDY REQUEST FORM Tony distributed the 1/11/01 working draft of the study request form. This form is the result of a combined effort of PSE and the agencies. The study request form addresses only the high-level concept of the study. It does not cover the actual study design, which would likely be developed by a consultant.  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT FOR 1/22/01 MEETING NOTES L Wiltse for Recreation Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 2   When citing references attach them if possible. Team leaders will be responsible for coding and tracking studies from their Working Groups. The group reviewed the form. In order to request studies, participants are asked to fill in at least the first two steps of the form. Participants were asked to submit study requests for the 2001 field season to Chris by Feb.9th. This is a suggested date, but not a "drop dead" date, as it is likely that unanticipated needs for studies will arise throughout the process. Chris will collate all the study requests and send them out for participants to review approximately one week prior to our February meeting. We hope that at our February 26th meeting, we can approve studies for the 2001 field season. Chris will be submitting requests for studies oriented to the FERC regulation requirements for the team to review at that meeting. Studies for the 2002 field season should be submitted by our September meeting. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS FLOOD CONTROL PRESENTATION Wayne Wagner opened by explaining the integral relationship the Corps has with PSE for providing flood control. He emphasized that flood storage at Upper Baker and Ross (on the Skagit) reduces the magnitude and frequency of flood events, but doesn't actually prevent floods. His very informative presentation addressed these four areas: <b7> Why flood control? <b7> How dams are managed for flood control <b7> Effects of flood control <b7> Where are we going? He will look into making available an EIS to this working group. His presentation is available on the Baker River Project Website. STUDY REQUESTS Lauri emailed suggestions for two studies to Chris and he emailed them out to all members at the end of last week. They are: 1. Recreation Capacity and Suitability Analysis 2. Recreation Needs Analysis Ann distributed and briefly explained five draft study requests from the Forest Service using the study request form. They are: 1. Recreation Site Inventory (draft) 2. Visitor Use Survey and Market Analysis (draft) 3. Lake Level Study for recreation (with other resources) (draft) 4. Recreational Fishing Study (draft) 5. Visuals and Aesthetics Study (draft) The team clarified the following definitions: "Dispersed"---scattered; takes place around the landscape. These sites can be managed, but not to the extent that developed sites are. Usually no capital investments; always exceptions "Displaced"---can happen for a number of reasons; change in usage/availability/access/temporal  BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT FOR 1/22/01 MEETING NOTES L Wiltse for Recreation Working Group FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 3   A question was raised re: the inclusion of the Upper South Fork of the Nooksack in the study area. This will be considered on a study-by-study basis, if it can be shown to be project related, or if there is a reasonable case that a study will demonstrate that it is project related. PARKING LOT - Visioning exercise - Organizational/agency goals - Bounce around with meeting locations - Operationally define "vicinity", "watershed", "project induced", "dispersed", or "displaced" - List authorities that this team must be aware of - Be sure someone from Recreational Resources area sits on the Solution Team. - Look at dispersed recreation with the Project as a whole. - Look into getting guest speaker from Seattle City Light - Tie education piece to ALL Working Groups - Hold periodic "outreach" meetings for feedback from other groups (hiking, horseback riding, etc.) - Land Management - Get a National Park Service rep - Forest Service presentation of SMS - Need good maps of the project area EVALUATION OF MEETING Things Done Well <b7> Wayne's informative presentation Need for Improvement <b7> Need more time <b7> May need to use Technical Working Groups to flesh out studies TENTATIVE AGENDA FOR FEBRUARY MEETING February 26, 2000 Agenda 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. at PSE Office in Mt.
