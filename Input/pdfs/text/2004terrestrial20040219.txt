Posted on website. Final Report is out. Posted on website along with the other final reports. Final Report is out, including the rare plant addendum. Posted on website.-Amphibian addendum hasn’t been agreed on and won’t impact our ability to reach settlement. Was finalized with the comments received at the end of December. Tony explained we are now including three hydrology metrics –piezometer fluctuations, rainfall, and Baker Lake elevations. We will continue to monitor these readings through fall of 2004. Tony shared preliminary data from this study. Water level fluctuations of the upper two piezometers were not caused by reservoir elevations, but closely followed rainfall events. These data will let us know what existing conditions are relating to wetlands. It appears, at this point, that lower reservoir levels would not adversely impact this wetland (WB 30).  PRESENTATION OF COSTS FROM SOLUTION TEAM MEETING Kris distributed a summary sheet that showed the history of PSEs estimates of costs NPV, 2006 dollars not adjusted for inflation since the initial PDEA. It showed how costs by resource area changed between PDEAs. It contained a column outlining the PDEA costs with/PMEs in dispute. It also showed a range of numbers averaged from nine other Northwest relicense settlements. He then described a 2nd work sheet showing a summary of NPV, nominal dollars (including inflation) of $/MWh by the same categories as the first sheet. These are the numbers the WUTC will be using to evaluate the prudency of the amount PSE agrees to in our settlement. If PSE signed up for what’s in the 2/04 PDEA today, their power costs would be $32.8/MWh. The original “numbers” that PSE thought it could defend (that the Solution Team had asked Ed not to disclose back in October) was $28 MWh. Kris thinks it’s possible that PSE upper management might support $32 MWh (though he cannot say this with any certainty at this point). Adding in the categories of costs listed in the Risk Uncertainty category (seismic upgrades, flood control upgrades), this number rises to $42.5, which is a number PSE cannot/will not support. If anyone has questions related to these costs, please, contact Kris Olin (Kris.Olin@PSE.com), 425-4623051.  REVIEW OF LATEST DRAFT OF TERRESTRIAL LICENSE ARTICLES Tony distributed copies of the draft license Articles prepared by the Louis Berger Group for our review/approval before they are passed to the Legal Working Group and copied to the Solution Team. Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Terrestrial Resources Working Group February 19, 2004  Page 3 of 5   Most of the PMEs were incorporated under the Terrestrial Resources Management Plan. We have committed to turn these around by March 4. That translates into getting any comments back to Tony by February 27. There are still questions about 3.4.4 (the Aquatics PME on Riparian Habitat Restoration and Enhancement). This was distributed at the last Aquatic Resource Working Group meeting and is being reviewed by its members. Tony will attach the latest version of this (December 4, 2003) to these minutes for our review (by February 27). Ideally, terrestrial interests would be covered by this PME. Concern was expressed about having Aquatics folks control implementation of the entire PME amount. PME PROPOSALS SENT TO THE BERGER TEAM FOR THE PDEA At the time of Louis Berger’s deadline for submissions for the PDEA that will be submitted along with the license application on April 30, PSE submitted everything agreed to ( by January 30) by the Working Groups. For those items not yet resolved at the Working Group level, PSE made their best effort to propose something that reflects the interests of all participants in the process. The Terrestrial package adds up to $10,497,000 face value. Marty walked us through what had changed since our last version (January 15) of the PME table that we were using for discussions. He will update this table and send it out for review. THE TERRESTRIAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN OUTLINE The latest draft (January 13) was sent out as a starting point for discussions by this group. The Lewis River relicense has served as a basis for this draft plan and then was tailored for the Baker Project. We will continue to flesh this out through Working Group discussions over the course of the next several months. We need to agree on a timeline for completion of the plan. PME 1.6.1 proposes a schedule. FERC will need to see the plan within a year after the issuance of the license. We need to outline in the PME what piece(s) we want to complete earlier. We’ll work to make this language consistent with other license articles –“within three months…” We may want to begin the process within the next three months and in one year have a draft plan. Setting objectives would be among the first steps in developing the Plan (the draft Plan presently includes objectives). We might also want to distinguish between capped items vs. non-capped (portions of plant associated PMEs and Plan development). The Plan should cover only designated existing PMEs (vs. brand new, high cost activities). We need to decide whether we need to also attach an outline of the Plan to the Settlement Agreement. It may be in the best interest of the resource to keep reference to the Plan at a high level for the Settlement Agreement.
