Arnie – By 10/16 email our new Downstream Passage PME language (from 10/14 Fish Passage Technical Working Group meeting) to team members. 2. Cary and Arnie – Look at integrating Stan’s and Scott’s PMEs. Email out key questions, etc. as needed (prior to October 27 meeting). 3. Sue – Write up implementation aspects of the Lower Baker River Alluvial Fan prior to October 27 meeting. 4. Arnie – Confirm location of November 21 RESOLVE Meeting and include in these notes (the meeting is at the USFS Building, Mountlake Terrace) Old Action Items 1. Bob W—Draft language revisions to 3.5 (Water Quality). This will be worked through at the Technical Working Group meeting at November 14. Report on Completed Action Items 1. Bob W. sent information to Arnie resulting in the division of 3.4.3 (reservoir shoreline erosion) and 3.5.4 (other erosion). 2. Sue rewrote the Summary of Actions in 3.4.1 (Fluvial Geomorphic Management--page 61) to reflect the actions set forth in the PME. 3. Ruth and Scott augmented Connectivity PME to cover study for native fish. 4. Arnie sent Sue’s FGM to group. 5. Cary rewrote Modification section of 3.2.2 (Downstream Passage) to clarify funding intent. 6. Cary drafted appendix on downstream passage performance standards and evaluation (based on BAG proposal). Notes from RESOLVE Meetings To permit the greatest degree of open dialogue, the group agreed that notes for the RESOLVE sessions will be less formal than regular working group meetings. We will primarily document agreements and action items. RESOLVE Groundrules • Work at understanding one another. • Use airtime wisely. • Speak honestly and respectfully. • Examine assumptions. • Make tentative agreements, then look at the whole package together. • One meeting review rule: We have one meeting to review and change the tentative agreements of the previous RESOLVE session.1 • Document our agreements. • Caucuses are okay. 1 All agreements are tentative even after the “one meeting review rule”. However, the one meeting rule gives regular participants an opportunity to bring an agreement back to the table while assuring that tentative agreements are not forever reopened. It also accommodates regular participants who must miss a meeting and may want to weigh in on a decision. Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Aquatics Resources Working Group RESOLVE Session October 16, 2003 Page 2 of 4 Note: In this meeting, we worked from the 4th draft PMEs dated October 16, 2003. 3.2.2: Address Connectivity between Baker Lake and Lake Shannon Ruth walked us through changes she and Scott propose to the language of this PME to cover studies for native fish. We agreed on the following changes to their revised language: Under Description of Action: Change “no later than three years after (removed ‘of’) license acceptance…” Second Bullet under Description of Action: • 2nd sentence: Change ‘tributaries to the reservoirs’ to ‘reservoir tributary reaches accessible to adfluvial fish’… • 2nd to the last sentence; Change ‘transported’ to ‘collected through other means and transported’. Questions for Future Consideration: • What would be the benchmark to differentiate between groups of fish that are isolated from some other means? • What triggers the need to start electro-shocking/moving fish? • Would we have a strong enough base genetic sample to do this analysis? 3.2.3: Downstream Passage We reviewed the changes to this language made by the Fish Passage Technical Working Group on October 14 and discussed the various testing elements. Outstanding Issues: • Definition of criteria, timing for performance standards • Timing of compensation • What is the timeframe for implementation at Lower Baker? • Need to address continuation of current studies (Cary added some language here). 3.5: Water Quality This will be discussed in a technical working Group meeting with Bob Wright on November 14. 3.4.4: Habitat Restoration Scott reported that the Forest Service doesn’t have to be the sole decision maker on this. It can be decided by the BRCC if the Forest Service is a member. There still needs to be discussion about the BRCC decision making process. Scott further reported that we can move the miles of habitat to be restored from the PME to the section on rationale. Discussion of a dollar amount would be negotiated by the Solution Team. Agreements: • We agreed to integrate Stan’s new PME (Skagit Basin Restoration Acquisition Fund) into this one. We will need to resolve the in-basin/out-of-basin mix. • We agreed to move the HERC Fund to 3.6. Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 Aquatics Resources Working Group RESOLVE Session October 16, 2003 Page 3 of 4 • The Aquatics Species Management Plan will be treated as an informational piece, but not an overall guiding document or roadmap for all the other measures. It will have its own number, without sub-numbers under it. 3.4.1: Fluvial Geomorphic Management Phil described the issues around the intent of the measure vs. the action associated with the project. Agreements: • Monitoring aspects of Alluvial Fan and Middle Skagit River will be represented in the Appendix for PME 3.4.1. • Implementation aspects of Lower Baker River Alluvial Fan will be part of PME 3.4.1. (Sue will write this up prior to our Oct. 27 meeting.) • Implementation aspects of gravel augmentation is part of the HERC Fund. Edits to PME: We changed the wording under description of Proposed Action, Lower Baker River: • Second sentence: Changed ‘geomorphic function’ to ‘habitat condition’. 3.3.1: Implement Flow Regime This action points to a yet undefined Flow Schedule (including flow rates, ramping, and amplitude and cycling) in the Appendix. The current draft is based on three hydrologic scenarios (normal, high and low water years). After more HYDROPS runs, we may have a better idea of how appropriate that is and how best to handle this. 6.3: Reservoir Level Management We added that the figures in Table 3 are based on the 1929 datum. We need to reconcile Table 3 with inputs being used for HYDROPS and the corresponding rationale. Note: The County is proposing flexibility in the elevations of Shannon.
