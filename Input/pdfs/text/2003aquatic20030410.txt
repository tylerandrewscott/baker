Use this list as agenda for the conference call. <b7> ALL: Plan to phone in for the April 21 conference call! <b7> Sue: Send Arnie sediment proposed actions to distribute. <b7> Scott: Send comments to Arnie on A39. <b7> ALL: Review A24 Part 1 report and got comments to Sue by end of April.  Baker River Project Relicense Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 4-10-03_Final_fishWG_notes; Lyn Wiltse  2 of 10   <b7> Mark: Send out the revised Study Request on A36: Native & Wild Inland Fish Population Assessments (prior to our February meeting) for discussion at our March meeting. ACTION ITEMS CARRIED OVER FROM APRIL 1 AND 2 RETREAT <b7> Tung: Make available a list of assumptions used by the HYDROPS model. <b7> Tung: Talk with PSE re: additional enhancement to model (as per Lorna's suggestion re: switching timing based on different priorities). <b7> Tung: Make sure new version of HYDROPS model is functional and available by April 15. <b7> Paul: Get folks results from the 11 runs. Need to verify input data, along with corresponding explanation. <b7> All: Review Study Report for A9c. Be ready to discuss at our May 8 meeting. <b7> Stan (Gary): Set up a meeting of BAG (Baker Agency Group) to address goals for fish passage (May 6). <b7> All: Send Stan your ideas on goals for fish passage by April 15. <b7> Sue: Put together draft study plan for alluvial fan (A16) along with draft PME language by May 1. SETTLEMENT PROCESS <ad> STATUS OF 2nd DRAFT ACTIONS Concern was expressed that technical decisions about what to include in the second draft actions. We want to resolve all we can at the working group level. We also want folks at the Solution Team to have the authority to speak for their organizations on issues of settlement. Cary assured us that Ed Schild has that authority. We reviewed the edits made to the initial draft proposed actions at and since the April 1 and 2 retreat. Cary fleshed out the pieces he was asked to (fish propagation, etc). Scott Lenz brought language on habitat PME and Greta Movassaghi brought language on erosion. We agreed to change 3.4.3 to be Erosion Control. Within this section, we will call out specific components within the arena of erosion. Each area will have its own management plan. As we walked through the draft proposed actions, we noted where we have strong agreement and where we don't yet have specifics to pass on to the Louis Berger for evaluation in the PDEA. We are in pretty good shape on these draft proposed actions: <b7> 3.1.1 HERC Fund (Concern was expressed that the size of the fund has not been called out). Cary explained that this is still fluid as several issues that were originally slated to be handled through that fund are being defined separately. To the extent that this continues to occur, the size of the fund will be reduced accordingly. <b7> 3.2.1 Upstream Fish Passage (should address which species the facility will and will not work for.) TNC is interested in how we will address migrating species that it won't work for. <b7> 3.3.2 Implement Flow Release Water Quality Management <b7> 3.4.2 Implement Large Woody Debris Management <b7> 3.5.1 Implement Reservoir Water Quality Management  Baker River Project Relicense Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 4-10-03_Final_fishWG_notes; Lyn Wiltse  3 of 10   FERC RELICENSING TIMELINE FOR AQUATICS TASKS Proposed Actions <b7> 2nd Draft Proposed Actions are due May 1, 2003. <b7> 2nd Draft Proposed Actions will be out for review by May 7, 2003 <b7> Cross Resource Workshop will be on May 14, 2003 (8:00-5:00 at the Embassy Suites in Lynnwood) <b7> Complete revisions are due June 1, 2003 (for PDEA)  FISH PASSAGE TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP REPORT There was nothing new to report. They are meeting again April 28. We will get an update at out May 8 meeting.  INSTREAM FLOWS UPDATE (A-9) Phil distributed a diagram outlining R2s Fish Habitat Model of the Middle Skagit River. He reported that on March 16, 17 they were able to get the remaining transect data for high flows. We are currently awaiting data from Pacific International Engineering. In the meantime, R2 is beginning to develop the hourly hydrograph.  At the May 2 Instream Flows Technical Working Group, he will propose Varial Zone and Spawning Incubation as the two highest priority models to develop. Other models will include habitat indices for side channels, backwater sloughs, mainstem and off-channel surface area, PHABSIM outputs and possibly spatial niche analyses.  Some HYDROPS runs will warrant further investigation. These will be the ones we run through the habitat models (starting with varial zone and spawning incubation). Results of the May 2 Technical Working Group meeting will be presented at our May 8 meeting.  All Working Groups should be considering HYDROPS scenarios they would like to see run NOW!

ACTIVE. This study has been combined with A26. This was largely handled through PME discussions at the April 1, 2 Retreat. R2 is ready to finalize the report. Comments will be appended to the report and addressed as appropriate. All comments must be in by April 21. This is being addressed by A9 and A24. No longer necessary due to change in management direction in favor of cancellation of non-native trout stocking in the reservoirs. Removed from list of studies we will consider. This is being addressed through A15. All were asked to get comments on Part 1 (hydrologic) by April 30. Part 2 (geomorphic) is nearly complete. Sue will try to get it out by April 18. All were asked to come to our May 8 meeting with questions/comments for discussion. Nick reports that we have conducted 28 field days of monitoring (visual observations, transparency, hook and line, snorkeling, etc.) at Blue Tarp and the seaplane launch. Captured fish include 3 sculpin, 2 chinook, 2 sockeye and 10 char. Stomach contents have included 35 sockeye fry, including a 70 mm. sockeye removed from the stomach of a 129 mm. sculpin. Native trout and char tagging are being conducted in support of those studies. Nick reported that we have received part of this report. He hopes to send the draft report out for review by April 24. All were asked to come to the May 8 meeting with your comments. Concern was expressed about the researchers lack of familiarity with our local West Coast situation. Results combined in the report for A01a and A01b and expected by the April 10 meeting. Addressed in A9. Now addressed in Fish Passage Studies A30 to A34. ACTIVE This year, we have sockeye emerging out of Beach 3 and 4. For now, we have agreed to collect and preserve 100 samples. We can determine what to do with them latter on (otolith analysis). 6 of 10   R-A30 Near-Field Smolt Behavior R-A31 Fish Passage-Far Field Smolt Migration R-A32 Fish Passage-Kelt Radio telemetry R-A33 Fish Passage-PIT Tag Migration R-A34 Fish Passage-Downstream Run-Timing Correlation R-A35 Fish Passage-Upstream Run-Timing R-A36 Native & Wild Inland Fish Population Assessments R-A37 Without Project Alternative (evaluation of Aquatic & Riparian Habitat) R-A38 Bull Trout Population Assessment & Risk Analysis R-39 Native Non Salmonid  Completed.

Sue reported that work is ongoing. She is doing a review of the maps, etc. for this study. She will bring a final map to our May 8 meeting for discussion. Phil received the draft Study Plan and is reviewing it. He will send it to Gene the week of April 30. Pending Gene's approval, the plan will be sent out to Working Group members. Phil prepared a paper on what species are in the Baker River Project basin and what their habitat is. We will look at linking this to A1, 2, 9, 15, 16, 24, 37, 17, 26b and fish passage. Sue and Phil will follow up with Ruth and Scott on how to handle this.
