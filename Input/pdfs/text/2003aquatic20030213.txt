Keith Brooks of FERC will be issuing an interpretation of the legal mandates by Feb. 19. REVIEW RELICENSE SCHEDULE (This will occur only when there are substantive changes.) PLAN FOR MARCH CROSS-RESOURCE WORKSHOP Prior to the Workshop A CD listing all the 1st draft PMEs that each Working Group is considering along with a draft agenda for the March Workshop will be out by February 18th. Participants will be asked to fill out a pre-workshop worksheet to consider how to resolve conflicts, etc. PSE will send out their proposal (with elements of Working Group PMEs) for review on Feb. 26. This proposal is a subset of the PMES brainstormed in the Working Groups and takes into account the interests of stakeholders in the process. Baker River Project Relicense 3 of 11 Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 2-13-03_Final_fishWG_notes; Lyn Wiltse March 4, Tuesday (afternoon only) 1:00-5:00 High level PMEs presentations by a member of each Working Group (Cultural, Terrestrial, Aquatics, Recreation, Economics/Operations) Phil has graciously accepted our request that he do our presentation. (Cary will be a back-up if there are “high flows”) Probable Attendees: Phil (presenter), Nick, Gary, Brady, Scott, Steve, Arn, Ruth, Paul, Cary, Chuck, and Arnie March 5, Wednesday (all day) Dee will begin with a review of the background of our process to date. She will then do a brief training session on interest-based negotiations to kick things off. Then we will walk through PSE’s Proposal, highlighting pieces that have cross-resource implications e.g., the proposed reservoir management regime. Joel Molander of PSE will explain how PSE came up with its reservoir management plan (share outputs from HYDROPs model runs, etc.) Then we will split up into small cross-resource groups to: • Flag impacts on resource (add conflicts to lists already posted from Feb. Working Group meeting) • List how it affects the organizational interests • Report back to the larger group Probable Attendees: Phil, Nick, Gary, Steve, Arn, Ruth, Cary, Paul, Chuck, Arnie March 6, Thursday (all day) Finish PSE Proposal (pieces with cross resource implications) Review other PMEs with cross resource implications Review (amended) list of conflicts Brainstorm to resolve conflicts Review (amended) list of conflicts Brainstorm to optimize synergies Plan next steps Probable Attendees: Phil, Nick, Gary, Steve, Arn, Ruth, Paul, Cary, Chuck, Arnie General Feedback • Concern was expressed about the process of PSE putting forth a “draft proposal”, as a more collaborative process would have involved a jointly developed proposal. • Concern was also expressed about discussing what might end up in the Settlement Agreement when important studies were still outstanding. • Concern was also expressed that there doesn’t seem to be a process (within or across) Working Groups where substantive issues are discussed. • Appreciation was expressed for PSE responding to the Solution Team request that they take the first step by putting the initial draft proposal together. Baker River Project Relicense 4 of 11 Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 2-13-03_Final_fishWG_notes; Lyn Wiltse FISH PASSAGE TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP REPORT The Group met February 12. They are still narrowing options for downstream passage. Concern was expressed that the criteria being used to narrow this list take into consideration passage of all migrating fish. Comment from Brady Green, USFS, to replace last sentence with: Brady stated that the USFW would like the fish passage (upstream & downstream) criteria for each alternative to clearly display how they will meet, or not meet, or if it is unknown whether they will meet migration requirements for all native fish species. How well alternatives meet migration criteria for each fish species needs to be carried forward through the entire alternative selection process. INSTREAM FLOWS UPDATE (A9) See table below. STUDY REQUEST SUBMITTALS/STUDY PLAN DEVELOPMENT Study # Title Notes/Next Steps A01.A Reservoir Tributary Habitat Surveys The draft report that R2 has prepared “Habitat Conditions and Salmonid Use of Tributaries” is nearly completed. The report will include summaries for each stream. Phil will distribute the report for our review prior to our meeting March 13 (in time for PDEA). ACTIVE A01.B Reservoir Tributary Biological Surveys See report for 101.A. ACTIVE A01.C Reservoir Tributary Delta Surveys See report for 101.A. ACTIVE A02 LB River Habitat Mapping Sue is working up with results on the physical habitat. This will tie in with A16. A03 Reservoir Fish Population No action yet. PSE will review existing information Characteristics for the PDEA. A04 LB/Skagit River Flow, Gaging Not discussed. Last meeting Phil reported that they downloaded pressure sensors last and are still in the process of collecting data. Links to A9. ACTIVE A05 Water Quality Sampling Data collection underway as per Study Plan. This study will be ongoing through Spring, 2004. Hoping to have all requirements fulfilled for Water Quality Certification. A06 UB Passage Design Baffle Complete. Modification A07 Lower Baker Forebay Bathymetry Complete. A08 UB Passage System Evaluation Complete. A09A Skagit River Flow and Habitat Phil reported that R2 measured low (about 4.5K Assessment cfs) and median (about 11.5K cfs), conditions along 24 transects last fall. They also identified substrates and covers at that time. Baker River Project Relicense 5 of 11 Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 2-13-03_Final_fishWG_notes; Lyn Wiltse On January 30 they were able to get the upper 8 of the 24 transect readings, which really represents about ¼ of the work since the remaining transects are more difficult to obtain. Since then, they have been waiting for high flow conditions (around 21K cfs) to get the remaining 16 measurements. Phil is hoping we can get these during the May/June time frame. In the meantime, they are beginning to process the data from the upper 8 transects. R2 will use examples of the 3 different flow conditions as input for HYDROPS runs. We will get an update at our April meeting. A09B Salmonid Redd Selection and Adam is researching what type of spike in flow Maintenance in the Middle Skagit in (over what window of time is required to influence Response to River Fluctuation from spawning behavior. He observed fish moving over Hydropower Peaking formerly shallow water redds after they had become submerged by a higher flow. It would be interesting to discover if fish will establish a redd in an 18-hour time period because that is a typical cycle for Baker Project peaking. Steve observed that as water comes up the fish come in to spawn. R2 will continue to look at this when PSE resumes a regular operating schedule. A09C Distribution, Timing and Depth of PDEA contractors have requested a description of Salmonid Redds life history and timing of spawning for all species. These data will be out prior to our March meeting for discussion. A09D Distribution, Timing of Salmonid Fry After our January meeting, Phil got 2001 and 2002 WDFW Mt. Vernon screw trap data. They are integrating this into a report to be out in the next couple of weeks (including scoop trap and Baker trap data). A10 Baker River Delta Habitat Assessment- Complete. Note: USFW is concerned with impacts Char to char and indirectly to bald eagles through chum and also to cutthroat. A11 Nutrient Addition Tie to A26. A12 Instream Flows for Bio-diversity Split between R-A21 & R-A09. A13A Water Quality Impacts of Human Uses Not discussed. Removed from list of studies this of the Reservoir and Adjacent Shorelines. group will address, reported by Brady in September. Greta reported the USFS will pursue this in the recreation working group. A13B Water Quality Impacts on Aquatic Removed from list of studies we will address. Habitat Tabled for now. Awaiting results of A14a. A14A Reservoir Shoreline Erosion The report will be out for review in the next few Baker River Project Relicense 6 of 11 Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 2-13-03_Final_fishWG_notes; Lyn Wiltse weeks (prior to our March meeting). A15 UB Delta Scour Field work is complete. Hope to have the report in March 2003. A16 Lower Baker River Alluvial Fan A Technical Working Group met on this January Assessment 17. Sue is putting together a draft Study Plan to scope out alternatives for additional study in this area. In the meantime, the ACOE is working on narrowing down the list of Little Baker alternatives. We will consider also collecting data on numbers, types and locations of fish strandings. Depending on opportunities to combine with other studies we may include the Little Baker River as a Study site. A17 Tributaries Surveys Upstream of Brady walked us through the main edits he made to Barriers this Study Request as a result of feedback he received since our last meeting. The focus of the Study Request is to get some baseline data on resident fish populations above anadromous barriers and to identify potential PMEs for Project effects on resident trout and trout habitats. Maybe this could become part of a resident trout package. One question we are trying to answer is how we can provide more low gradient habitat in the Basin. It may be appropriate to integrate this into A36 and A37 as a next step. Brady will take another look at this with that perspective. A18 Baker River Survey Upstream of 1 km. Merged into A01a and A01b. ACTIVE. A19 Review Limnological Information This study has been combined with A26. A20 Large Woody Debris Management Phil reported that the first draft of this report is ready for review. The report contains data that will be helpful in developing a woody Debris Management Plan. Phil will attach a letter to the report and send out for our review by February 18th that identifies the opportunities being considered. At our March meeting, we will discuss this report and next steps. We need to agree on how to handle the wood. A21 Skagit Wild & Scenic River Values This is being addressed by A9 and A24. A22 Baker Lake Trout Impacts Evaluation No longer necessary due to change in management direction in favor of cancellation of non-native trout stocking in the reservoirs. Removed from list of studies we will consider. A23 Baker River Wild & Scenic River This is being addressed through A15. Values A24 Hydrologic and Geomorphic Analysis R2 is making final edits to this report and is expected to be distributed for review by the March Baker River Project Relicense 7 of 11 Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 2-13-03_Final_fishWG_notes; Lyn Wiltse 13 meeting. A25 Unnatural Predation Nick reported that Carl Hadley and Michelle will be getting started on this next week. This will include sampling at both traps. They will also look at sculpin. The original Study Request called for a mark -recapture. This is not included in the Study Plan. After considerable discussion around the statistical validity of data we might get from a mark – recapture, we agreed to try to integrate this into the Study Plan. Nick will follow up with Stan on this by the end of February. A26A Reservoir Limnology-Production This Study is underway. At first blush, it appears Potential that we are not nutrient limited in the reservoir. We expect to get a report from Asit Mazumder this Spring (possibly March). A26B Tributary Production Potential Results combined in the report for A01a and A01b and expected by the March 13 meeting. A27 Middle Skagit Incubation Flows Addressed in A9. A28 Fish Passage-Reservoir Management Now addressed in Fish Passage Studies A30 to A34. ACTIVE A29 Estimate Sockeye Production from Nick reported that there are no plans to collect data Different Incubation Sources for this study this year, as last year, when we ran 2 samples, no sockeye fry from the Baker River were found and this year, we didn’t place any adult sockeye in the reservoir. After some discussion, he agreed to go ahead and collect a sample of 100 fry from each source this year. We can determine at a later date if we analyze the data. R-A30 Near-Field Smolt Behavior Completed. Coordinated through Fish Passage Tech. Group. 2002 Field effort completed, data analysis underway- results will be reported at the Fish Passage meeting in December. R-A31 Fish Passage-Far Field Smolt Migration Completed. Coordinated through Fish Passage Tech. Group. R-A32 Fish Passage-Kelt Radio telemetry Completed. Coordinated through Fish Passage Tech. Group. R-A33 Fish Passage-PIT Tag Migration Completed. Coordinated through Fish Passage Tech. Group. R-A34 Fish Passage-Downstream Run-Timing Completed. Coordinated through Fish Passage Correlation Tech. Group. R-A35 Fish Passage-Upstream Run-Timing Completed. Coordinated through Fish Passage Tech. Group. R-A36 Native & Wild Inland Fish Population Not discussed. At the December meeting Mark Assessments reported that his field season wound up just before Baker River Project Relicense 8 of 11 Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 2-13-03_Final_fishWG_notes; Lyn Wiltse the holidays. He is in the process of fleshing out (number of samples, location etc.) this Study Request Methodology would include WDFW crews taking samples in the river and PSE taking samples from PSE’s traps. PSE would cover the costs of lab work for genetic analysis, which would be performed by WDFW. Mark will send the revised Study Request out for our review prior to February meeting. We will discuss of that request at that meeting. R-A37 Without Project Alternative (evaluation ACTIVE; Will proceed. Update at the March 13 of Aquatic & Riparian Habitat) meeting. R-A38 Bull Trout Population Assessment & A Technical Working Group met on January 29 to Risk Analysis discuss char in the Baker System. They propose we take genetic samples on all char captured during the A-25, fish transport and other activities, and floy- tag and fin clip char at selected sites to identify movement. R-39 Native Non Salmonid Ruth wants to propose that this Study address project effects on non-salmonid species, specifically: • Habitat that is being inundated and therefore unavailable • Impacts of reservoir separating populations She is looking for someone to partner with in fleshing out this Study. Given the late date, it may make sense to suggest how to address this as a PME instead of going through the formal study process. We could also look at increasing the scope of other studies to include non-salmonids. As a next step, Phil will put together a table of non- salmonids and project affects on each. We will review this at our March meeting. SOLUTION TEAM UPDATE The Solution Team requested that PSE put together a “straw” proposal to help move us along in terms of putting together the PDEA and, ultimately, moving toward a Settlement Agreement. PSE will send this out prior to the Cross-Resource Workshop. The discussion on Settlement Process was deferred until the March meeting. ADDITIONAL ISSUES? Brady brought copies of the Watershed Analysis to share with interested folks.

The study unexpectedly found that side channel habitat was critical for sturgeon spawning and rearing. Since white sturgeon are found this the middle Skagit River and there are some similarities between the two river systems, these study results may have some applicability to instream flow studies in the middle Skagit River below the Baker Project.
