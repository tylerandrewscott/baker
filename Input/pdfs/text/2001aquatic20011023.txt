Baker River Project Relicense Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 10-23-01_Final_fishWG_notes.doc; Lyn Wiltse  2 of 7   <b7> Arnie: Checked with Fred re: ESA presentation at October 23 meeting. <b7> Arnie: Got summary data of average daily flows over the last 10 years (inflow to Baker Lake).and for Watershed. <b7> Arnie: Got information on trap protocol. Distributed spreadsheet Baker Adult Fish Trap Protocol (revised 9/19/2001 <ad> Baker River Committee). And also a Draft of Baker Hydroelectric Project Adult Trap Protocols <ad> Baker River Committee, Proposed 6/12/2001.

Bob will be proposing a plan of different parameters/locations/frequencies, etc. to be examined for 401 certification. <b7> Phil & Don: Discussed boats. <b7> Brady: Sent Phil standards and guidelines relating to the affected section of Upper Baker River <b7> Nick/Bob: Provided update on PSE plans for gaging of Baker River. Still considering this. Need input from the group. Potential Wild & Scenic River Act designation may limit what we can do here. This will be handled as part of A9. <b7> Chuck: Sent Phil a copy of Scope of Work for Little Baker Feasibility Study. WILD & SCENIC RIVERS Brady reported that Congress awarded $2 million to the USFS to buy and protect land along the Wild & Scenic River corridor. He distributed a copy of the Seattle Times, October 22, 2001 article.  REPORT FROM FISH PASSAGE TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP They are narrowing down the downstream passage options to those that are most feasible. They postponed the October 17 session due to multiple scheduling conflicts among participants. During the November 1 meeting, they are going to brainstorm upstream passage options. They will also be looking at process and considering studies that will be helpful in narrowing options. The firm of Montgomery-Watson is developing a conceptual overview of some options such as fish ladders at both dams.  REPORT FROM BAKER RIVER COMMITTEE This group is an ad hoc technical group that has been meeting quarterly for the last fifteen years. Participants include USFS, PSE, NMFS, USFWS, WDFW, SSC, NPS and other interested persons. These meetings are open to anyone interested in attending. The goal of the group is to address fish issues and on going project operations related to fish. They discuss a variety of systemic issues. They are not dealing directly with any relicensing issues. We will continue to share information back and forth with this group as appropriate. We'll share the minutes from each of these quarterly meeting of the Baker River Committee with this Working Group. The 2002 meetings will be January 16, at the U.S. Forest Service Bldg, Sedro-Woolley; March 20 at Mountlake Terrace; June 19 at the Baker Project; and September 18 at La Conner.  UPDATE ON RAMPING RATES Baker River Project Relicense Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 10-23-01_Final_fishWG_notes.doc; Lyn Wiltse  3 of 7   PSE has put together a ramping protocol that meets the 2000 cfs/hour voluntary gradual unit shutdown that was established in 1978. This is achieved in two steps. First, they take the unit from 3000 cfs down to 1600 cfs and hold it for an hour. Then from there they drop it to minimum flow. PSE is continuing to investigate other opportunities.  PRESENTATION ON A01: TRIBUTARY HABITAT SURVEY RESULTS Doug Bruland gave an enjoyable PowerPoint presentation that summarized the results of the Tributary Habitat Survey. It is available on the PSE Relicensing Website. This is only the beginning of the data analysis. The field data will be analyzed to quantify the areas accessible to anadramous fish to identify basin production potential. Areas will be identified for potential enhancement as will surface areas available to specific species and habitat areas above barriers.  PRESENTATION ON ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT (ESA) Fred Seavey gave a very informative PowerPoint presentation on the details of the law as outlined in the Endangered Species Act (ESA) established by Congress in 1973. He did a great job of illustrating the various points (and confusing terms) with Baker-specific examples. He will email the presentation to Arnie to send out to meeting participants. The presentation will also be available on the PSE Relicensing Website.  STUDY REQUEST SUBMITTALS/STUDY PLAN DEVELOPMENT  Study #  Title  Notes/Next Steps  A01.A Reservoir Tributary Habitat Surveys Follow up meeting in January  A01.B Reservoir Tributary Biological Surveys Since the last meeting, PSE and R2 staff  conducted a combo walking/snorkel of the  Baker River from Crystal Creek (RM 24.7) to  the reservoir (RM 19) on 9/27-28, 10/4 and  10/16, NPS staff conducted a similar survey  downstream from Bald Eagle Creek waterfall  (RM 1 @ Baker RM 26.9) on 10/17/01. NPS  provided a copy of the year 2000 walk/snorkel  survey of Baker River from Sulphide Creek  (RM 23) to reservoir (RM 19) conducted on  10/31/00, 11/14/00 and 11/28/00.  A01.C Reservoir Tributary Delta Surveys  We've been hitting these when we do delta  spawning surveys. Hasn't been a lot to see.  Another part of this project is to map potential  habitat along the margins. We will begin to do  this now that the reservoir pool is dropping.  We also also looking for redds.  A02 LB River Habitat Mapping  Doug & Sue got out on Sept. 30 to identify  habitat areas, pebble counts, and measure  cross-sections. Nick and Phil will be going out  in next two weeks to assess fish usage.  Baker River Project Relicense Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 10-23-01_Final_fishWG_notes.doc; Lyn Wiltse  4 of 7   A03 Reservoir Fish Population  R2 summarized and distributed a list of data  Characteristics  they already have. They are looking for  additional data. All were asked to give them  references for additional data not included in  the handout (Baker Lake and Lake Shannon  Fish Information Sources <ad> DRAFT : October  17, 2001) before next mtg. PSE is talking to a  University of Washington researcher about  providing technical support.  A04 LB/Skagit River Flow, Gaging  Distributed charts showing stage relationships  for each of the temporary stage recorders  ("rulers in the river"). Sue also distributed an  updated map showing the locations of the  various gages. There are 2 new sites at wide  locations. The new sites show in green,  whereas the old sites show in red.  A05 Water Quality Sampling  Bob is working with Bob Barnes to put  together a plan to address water quality. Stay  tuned.  A06 UB Passage Design Baffle Modification Complete.  A07 Lower Baker Forebay Bathymetric Survey A08 UB Passage System Evaluation A09 Skagit River Flow and Habitat Assessment (HIGH PRIORITY)  Complete. 2001 Study portion complete.
