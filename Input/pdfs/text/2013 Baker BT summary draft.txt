The Project is currently operated by Puget Sound Energy (PSE) under a new license issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in October 2008. The new License authorizes PSE to operate the Project for a period of 50 years consistent with the terms and conditions of the new License. New license conditions address the capture and upstream transport of bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) from the Lower Baker River, the capture and downstream transport of bull trout from the Upper Baker reservoir (Baker Lake) and Lower Baker reservoir (Lake Shannon), and the potential capture and transport of bull trout from Lake Shannon to Baker Lake. Operation of an existing trap and haul facility for bull trout in the Lower Baker River and the downstream transport of bull trout that enter the downstream fish passage facilities provided the opportunity to collect tissue samples from fish in the basin. Additional tissue samples were collected by angling. The geographic origin of captured fish was determined by genotyping the fish and assigning them to a bull trout genetic baseline containing possible in-basin and out-of- basin source populations. Genetic analyses of fish indicated that 3/4 of the adult bull trout captured in the Lower Baker upstream fish trap originated outside the basin, from Downey Creek. This information should be considered in the development of conservation, management, and recovery plans for bull trout in the larger Skagit Basin. Genetic analyses also showed that a minority of adult bull trout captured in Lake Shannon were members of the Upper Baker gene pool, suggesting that bull trout from Baker Lake may have moved down over the Upper Baker 1 WDFW Baker Bull Trout 2013 Dam into Lake Shannon during spill events, or are progeny of adults in Lake Shannon that were both of Upper Baker genetic origin. Background Bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) are a species of char which express various life history strategies that utilize a wide variety of habitats for spawning, rearing and growth. Bull trout are an obligate cold-water species, requiring water below 9° Celsius for spawning – waters which are generally restricted to headwater streams (USFWS 2004). Their life history expressions are as follows: resident bull trout complete their life cycle within their natal headwater stream, spawning as small resident adults; fluvial bull trout migrate into larger rivers for rearing and growth, returning to their natal tributary to spawn as larger migratory fish; adfluvial bull trout migrate into lakes (or reservoirs) for rearing and growth, achieving still larger sizes with the greater food availability, and return to their natal tributaries to spawn; anadromous bull trout migrate to salt water for rearing and growth and amphidromous bull trout leave their natal basin and traverse salt water en route to other freshwater systems to rear and grow, both forms reversing the journey back to their natal stream to spawn (Brenkman and Corbett 2005). Bull trout populations are connected more or less by straying, forming metapopulations (Rieman and Dunman 2000). Migration is thus an important aspect of bull trout life history and critical to maintaining life history expressions and viability of the species. Bull trout were formerly distributed in inland and coastal drainages throughout Western North America as far south as California (Dunham et al. 2008). Over the past century their distribution and abundance declined due to land use activities such that in 1999 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed bull trout as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (Federal Register 1999). The Draft Recovery Plan (USFWS 2004) outlines bull trout population segments and recovery units throughout Puget Sound in Washington State. In northern Puget Sound, bull trout in the Baker River basin are part of the Lower Skagit core area recovery unit, which includes up to 21 bull trout populations in the Skagit River basin downstream of Seattle City Light’s Diablo Dam (Figure 1, see USFWS 2004). Four life forms of bull trout (resident, fluvial, adfluvial, and anadromous or amphidromous) are found in the Skagit basin. In contrast to other portions of the bull trout range, bull trout habitat in the Lower Skagit River is in excellent condition and adult bull trout numbers are estimated to be in the thousands (USFWS 2004). Despite good habitat condition in the Lower Skagit basin, in the Baker River system bull trout abundance has declined from the historical levels (“great quantities”) described in an early U. S. Fish Commission document (1901). Originally, the system consisted of Baker Lake and the mainstem and tributaries beyond the lake in the upper Baker, and mainstem and tributaries below Baker Lake in the lower Baker. We hypothesize that the basin supported all four bull trout life forms. Factors other than habitat are suspected in the decline of bull trout in the Baker system. In particular, barriers presented by the Lower and Upper Baker Dams affect fish movement in the Baker River system and are presumed factors in the decline in abundance of the anadromous life history form of bull trout in the basin. Lower Baker Dam, completed in 1926, blocked access to the system, although a fish ladder was constructed and there was trapping and hauling of fish into Lake Shannon, the reservoir that formed behind the dam (HRA 2000). Migratory fish exited Lake Shannon through the spillway and turbines. In 1959 Baker Lake was enlarged 2 WDFW Baker Bull Trout 2013 with the construction of the 312 ft. Upper Baker Lake Dam. Fish trapped below Lower Baker Dam were hauled into Baker Lake, and fish-attracting barges were installed in both lakes for downstream passage (HRA 2000). Prior to the late 1990’s, the concern for fishery managers was sockeye production in Baker Lake and trap and haul operations would have included bull trout as incidental fish. Upper Baker River, Bald Eagle Creek, Pass Creek, Crystal Creek, Sulphide Creek, and Swift Creek are known spawning and/or rearing areas for bull trout in the Baker Lake system, while Baker Lake provides primary habitat for foraging and overwintering (Figure 2). Brook trout are known to inhabit the Baker River system (Figure 3) but the level of hybridization appears low (Small et al. 2011). Dolly Varden occupy tributaries above anadromous barriers and are native in the upper Skagit core area but are unconfirmed in the lower Skagit core area (USFWS 2004). Previous work (Small et al. 2009, 2011) found no evidence of genetic interaction (hybridization) between bull trout and Dolly Varden in the Baker system. Issue PSE has operated an upstream fish trap and haul fish passage facility in the lower Baker River since 1926. Adult bull trout were collected at the lower Baker River trap and haul facility and, until recently, all bull trout were transported above the dams and released into Baker Lake. Earlier studies showed that these bull trout have a variety of origins: some originated in the upper Baker River basin and were returning to spawn, and some were from other Skagit Basin populations that have dipped into the lower Baker River (Small et al. 2009, 2011). Some bull trout that originated in populations outside the Baker River Basin appear to have reproduced within Upper Baker tributaries after being transported into Baker Lake. This phase of the project continues to explore the origins of adult bull trout and the results of management measures intended to reduce out-of-basin introductions. In this year’s analysis we identify samples (see Table 1a) using the recently expanded Skagit basin bull trout baseline (see Table 1b and Small et al. 2013). The genetic baseline was expanded with data from several bull trout populations throughout the Skagit basin collected by Matt Smith (Smith and Naish 2011) while at University of Washington (UW) under a contract with Seattle City Light (SCL). These data greatly enhance the existing WDFW bull trout population baseline for the Skagit basin and shed additional light on bull trout migration in the Skagit basin. The enhanced genetic baseline includes the original WDFW data (see Table 1b, 14 individuals collected in Lake Shannon that had assigned to Sulphur Creek were added to the Sulphur Creek population to boost the collection size) and additional UW/SCL data from bull trout populations throughout the Skagit basin (see Table 1b for list), as well as Dolly Varden from Diablo Lake in the Upper Skagit and a collection of brook trout from Lake Shannon. Reporting groups in the UW/SCL baseline follow Smith and Naish (2011). The enhanced baseline allows us to more precisely identify migratory bull trout adults collected below the Lower Baker River Dam at the Lower Baker River upstream fish trap (LB UFT). Lake Shannon, formed by the lower Baker Dam, also contains bull trout and they have been observed spawning in one primary tributary, Suphur Creek. Bull trout from Sulphur Creek have been identified as a local population which is genetically distinct from the bull trout population in the upper Baker basin (Small et al. 2009). Genetic analysis in this phase will enhance our understanding of the genetic relationships between bull trout in the upper and lower Baker basin 3 WDFW Baker Bull Trout 2013 and will facilitate management objectives that include transporting bull trout based on genetic origins. In the work described here, we used a suite of 16 microsatellite DNA loci to evaluate the genetic origin of bull trout collected by both active sampling methods, such as angling, and at fish passage facilities located in the Baker River Hydroelectric Project. The objectives of the work were: • Identify all samples as a bull trout, Dolly Varden, brook trout or hybrid (interspecific or interpopulation) using diagnostic genetic makers; • Genotype all bull trout collected throughout the Baker River Basin and assign them to population of origin; • Use population assignment tests and genetic clustering methods to distinguish among bull trout populations inhabiting the Baker River Basin; • Enter all samples examined in this study into the range-wide bull trout genetic database. Materials and Methods Sample Collection 2012-2013 Sampling for Population Assignment Tissue samples from bull trout in the Baker River Basin were collected from November 8, 2012 through November 7, 2013 by PSE staff and preserved in 100% non-denatured alcohol. Tissue samples were collected from bull trout encountered at the Baker upstream and downstream fish passage facilities and by angling. Collection of tissue samples is ongoing and part of the current management protocol for native char. Tissue samples collected in the Baker River below the Lower Baker River Dam were from adult bull trout at the Lower Baker River upstream fish trap (12AH and 13DW in Table 1a). Tissue samples collected in Lake Shannon were from juveniles, sub-adults and adults and were collected by trapping at the floating surface collector (FSC) and by angling (N = 16) and by angling in the riverine habitat (UB Tailrace) below the Upper Baker Dam (N = 33). Tissue samples collected in Baker Lake (Upper Baker) were from juveniles, sub- adults and adults were collected by trapping in the Upper Baker floating surface collector and by angling (N = 65). Genotypic Data Collection DNA was extracted from tissue samples using silica membrane kits (Macherey-Nagel). Fish were genotyped at 16 microsatellite DNA loci (Table 2) that are standardized among labs researching bull trout (Ardren et al. 2011). Microsatellite alleles were PCR-amplified using fluorescently labeled primers (see Table 2 for detailed PCR information). Primers that were fluorescently labeled with a vector tail (V) in our lab are identified in Table 2 by the label “V+a” after the primer (+a refers to a poly-a tail added to the reverse primer) and the concentration for the primer and the vector are given. The other primers were labeled at the factory when primers were constructed. PCRs were conducted in 384 well plates in 5 μl volumes employing 1 μl template with final concentrations of 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200μM of each dNTP, and 1X Promega PCR buffer. After initial two minute denature at 94°, PCR temperature profiles followed a touchdown protocol (see Table 2) where the annealing temperature is lowered after an initial number of cycles. In the touchdown protocol the first four (profile 1) or 10 (profile 2) cycles have 94° denaturing for 30 seconds, 60° annealing for 30 seconds (decrease 1° per cycle) and 4 WDFW Baker Bull Trout 2013 extension at 72° for 60 seconds. These are followed by 36 (profile 1) or 30 (profile 2) cycles with the same parameters except for annealing temperature decreases to 50°, and then a final 10- minute extension at 72°. Samples were run on an ABI 3730 automated DNA Analyzer and alleles were sized (to base pairs) and binned using an internal lane size standard (GS500Liz from Applied Biosystems) and GeneMapper software (Applied Biosystems). Genetic Analyses We used assignment tests and exclusion probabilities in the program GeneClass2 (Piry et al. 2004) to identify fish of unknown origin collected in the Baker system to a genetic baseline that included representative population samples from the Baker system and from the greater Skagit basin. Some collections from tributaries within sub-basins were combined into “reporting groups” because they were similar genetically (Table 1b). For instance, the WDFW collection from the Sauk River was combined with the SCL collection from Downey Creek, a tributary of the Sauk River, because they were genetically similar and different from the South Fork Sauk (according to the WDFW database, the 98_04Sauk River collection were adults collected in the mainstem near Darrington). The assignment test assigns fish to the baseline collection in which they have the highest likelihood of occurring, based on the genotype of the fish and allele frequencies of baseline populations. The baseline included the following populations and reporting groups: Suphur, UpperBaker, Bacon, Illabot, South Fork Sauk, Downey, Cascade, Above Gorge Dam, and Goodell, as well as brook trout and Dolly Varden (Table 1b). We used the Rannala and Mountain (1997) algorithm to calculate likelihoods that an individual fish originated in each of the baseline collections based on the genotype of the fish and allele frequencies of the baseline collections. The program calculates a relative likelihood value, which is a ratio of the highest likelihood over the next highest likelihood value and assigns the individual to the baseline collection with the highest relative likelihood value. We used a ratio threshold of 90% as a positive assignment. We also conducted an exclusion analysis to examine whether sampled fish may have originated in a population that was excluded from the baseline, using a Monte Carlo simulation in GeneClass2. The simulation created 10,000 individuals for each baseline collection to simulate the range of genotypes likely to be encountered for that collection. Then it computed assignment likelihoods for simulated individuals and compared the likelihood of the genotype of the fish in question to the distribution of the likelihoods for each simulated baseline collection. If probabilities of coming from each baseline collection are all below a threshold value, here 0.1%, then the individual likely arose from a population outside the baseline. This exclusion test differs from the relative likelihood value, which is a ratio of point estimates for the individual coming from each baseline collection. There is always a likelihood of assignment to each collection but the values may be extremely small for all assignments if the population of origin is absent from the baseline. This may be obscured by the relative likelihood value since an extremely small likelihood value may still be 100 times larger than the sum of the other extremely small likelihood values (e.g., 10-51 is 100 times larger than 10-53), yet the individual is 100 times more likely to assign to the collection with a (deceptively) high relative likelihood value. The baseline still lacks a bull trout collection from the White Chuck River in the Sauk subbasin, which produces many bull trout (Bret Barkdull, WDFW, pers. comm.). Migratory bull trout originating in the White Chuck River are likely to assign to another tributary in the Sauk subbasin for which a baseline sample is available. 5 WDFW Baker Bull Trout 2013 We used a Bayesian analysis implemented in STRUCTURE 2.2 (Pritchard et al. 2000) to estimate individual and population ancestry, examine species identities, and identify possible hybrids. STRUCTURE sorts individuals (or portions of individuals if they are hybrids) into a number of hypothetical clusters (K) in order to achieve Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and linkage equilibrium in the clusters or populations. We compared fish collected 2012-2013 to bull trout collections that were used as the baseline in the assignment analysis described above and set the possible number of clusters at 2 - 14. At a K-value of 2 we expected bull trout and brook trout to cluster separately. At a K-value of 3 we expected bull trout, brook trout and Dolly Varden to cluster separately. At higher K we expected clusters to subdivide according to populations. Analyses were conducted in 5 independent runs that allowed admixture with 50,000 burn-ins and 200,000 iterations. The burn-in runs move the analysis away from the starting conditions to prevent them from influencing the analysis. Results and discussion Genotypic data collection Samples collected in 2012-2013 amplified well and all were included in the study (Table 1a). There were some 100% matches among bull trout in the data set: fish number 13DX0023 matched fish number 13DX0024 and may have been a resampling of 13DX0023 rather than a sample from 13DX0024. They were sampled on the same day (Aug. 28, 2013) but were different sizes. Fish 13DX0024 was eliminated from analyses. There were two other matches of contemporary samples to samples collected last year: 13DY0057 matched 12AJ0046 and 13DY0059 matched 12AJ0071. In these cases the samples collected this year were larger than the samples collected last year and all were collected in Baker Lake, suggesting that the samples this year were resamples of fish collected last year. Genetic analyses GeneClass assignments and exclusion tests identified bull trout to their origins (Table 3a and 3b). We used 90% relative likelihood score as the cutoff value for a positive assignment. Most individuals had full genotypes, so there was sufficient assignment power to assign them. The fish collected in 2012 at the upstream fish trap in the Lower Baker River, was from Downey Creek and two of the three fish collected in 2013 were also from Downey Creek and one was from the Baker Basin. In comparison, assignments for fish collected in the adult trap from 2003 through 2012 indicated that the largest proportion of migratory fish came from Cascade (27%) and Downey (20%). This suggests that migratory fish from tributaries beyond the Baker River dip into the lower Baker River en route to spawning or feeding areas at other locations in the Skagit basin or elsewhere in Puget Sound. More than half of the fish collected in Lake Shannon assigned to the Sulphur Creek population from Lake Shannon and the rest of the fish assigned to the Upper Baker. This suggests that some fish originated in Sulphur Creek and other fish may have moved down from Baker Lake during spill events. Alternatively, fish assigning to Upper Baker may be progeny of adults in Lake Shannon that were both of Upper Baker genetic origin. Individuals with assignment probabilities below the 90% threshold had mixed likelihoods of assignment to Sulphur and Upper Baker in the STRUCTURE analysis (described below) suggesting that they may have had parents from both 6 WDFW Baker Bull Trout 2013 populations. Most individuals (56/65) collected in Baker Lake assigned as Upper Baker fish. Three fish from Baker Lake assigned to Sulphur, suggesting that these fish had been transported from the upstream fish trap into Baker Lake or had descended from fish that had originated in Sulphur Creek and were transported to Baker Lake. Two individuals appeared to be from outside the Baker basin (one each assigned to Cascade and Bacon). These two out-of-basin bull trout may have been collected below the dam and transported into Baker Lake. Of the six fish with less than 90% assignment probabilities, STRUCTURE indicated that two were primarily Upper Baker and the other four had mixed ancestry. No brook trout or Dolly Varden ancestry was detected in any fish collected in 2012-2013. The STRUCTURE analysis supported information from the GeneClass assignment tests. STRUCTURE sorts individuals (or portions of individuals if they are of mixed ancestry) into genetically similar clusters. In this analysis, we used membership in a cluster to identify genetically distinct groups – if most individuals collected from a location (e.g., Sulphur) occupy one cluster, this cluster is identified as the Sulphur cluster and the individuals within comprise the Sulphur population. For fish where the assignment likelihood threshold was below 90% in the GeneClass analysis, we used STRUCTURE to further examine the status of samples of uncertain origin (Table 5). For instance, 13DX0010 was unassigned in GeneClass but had 68% of its ancestry in the Sulphur cluster suggesting that it is a member of the Sulphur population but had some alleles common in Upper Baker population that decreased its assignment likelihood in the GeneClass analysis. In other cases, an individual with mixed ancestry would not assign with high likelihood to a single population in the GeneClass analysis and might assign as mixed ancestry in the STRUCTURE analysis. For instance 13DY0007 was unassigned and appeared to be a mix of Upper Baker, Cascade and Goodell ancestry. Because the baseline lacks the White Chuck population and is restricted to the Skagit basin, migratory bull trout from the White Chuck or outside the basin would not assign to the baseline and would have misleading ancestry in the STRUCTURE analysis. If the White Chuck population is sufficiently differentiated from other Skagit populations, the exclusion analysis in GeneClass could help identify these individuals but STRUCTURE is limited by cluster number and might be unable to identify these individuals. Most STRUCTURE results concurred with GeneClass results: individuals clustering within a particular population cluster in the STRUCTURE analysis were assigned to that same population by GeneClass (Figure 5a, 5b). Because no brook trout or Dolly Varden were detected in contemporary collections we only plot bull trout data. At K = 9, each of the baseline collections occupied their own cluster. Individuals collected from the upstream fish trap, Lake Shannon and Upper Baker basin assigned into one of these clusters (see Table 4 for the proportions of membership in each cluster for individuals sampled in 2012). In comparisons to GeneClass, there were a few individuals where STRUCTURE clustered the majority of the individual’s ancestry in one population cluster but GeneClass assigned it to a different population. As described in Small et al. (2009), there are differences between the analyses that generate differences in results. In STRUCTURE, the clusters (or populations) are composed of all individuals (or portions of hybrid individuals) that the analysis assigned or grouped into the cluster. This is done using an iterative process to sort an individual’s ancestry into clusters in order to achieve Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium (or minimize disequilibrium) in the 7 WDFW Baker Bull Trout 2013 clusters. Data are treated differently in the GeneClass analysis. In GeneClass, the program calculates a likelihood value for the individual arising from each of the baseline collections. Based on the individual’s genotype and allele frequencies in the pre-defined baseline collections, GeneClass assigns the individual to a baseline collection. Results from both analyses were mostly congruent but provided different perspectives. For instance, GeneClass can identify migrants and STRUCTURE can identify hybrids as well as hierarchical genetic relationships among population clusters. STRUCTURE identified some fish with mixed ancestry (over 30% ancestries in more than one cluster) that GeneClass assigned with > 90% likelihood to a single baseline population (Figure 5b, Table 4). For example, STRUCTURE divided 13DW0001 between the Upper Baker and Sulphur clusters but GeneClass assigned it to Upper Baker. Still other fish assigned to different populations with the two analyses. For example GeneClass assigned 13DY0023 to Sulphur and STRUCTURE clustered >86% of its ancestry in Upper Baker. Putative mixed-ancestry fish or differently assigned fish likely had alleles that were common in more than one population such that the STRUCTURE analyses assigned their ancestry to different population clusters. Further, the large size of the dataset (>800 samples), may have decreased the ability of STRUCTURE to partition the data: STRUCTURE performs well with up to around 10 genetic clusters and although we pooled data into reporting groups, there were more than 10 genetic groups in the dataset. However, mixed ancestry signals could also indicate hybridization or introgression from out-of-population fish spawning with local fish that had been introduced through the trap and haul operation. In summary: • Three out of four adult bull trout collected at the Lower Baker River upstream fish trap originated outside the Baker basin in the greater Skagit basin (Downey Creek). • Of bull trout analyzed from the Lower Baker River upstream fish trap, the only bull trout with origins in the Baker basin was an Upper Baker origin adult collected in July. • Fifty-two percent of the bull trout collected in Lake Shannon assigned to Sulphur Creek, 42% assigned to the Upper Baker basin, and 6% were unassigned. • Eighty-three percent of the bull trout captured by angling from or collected in the Upper Baker downstream fish passage facility (Upper Baker FSC) had ancestry in the Upper Baker River basin, 5% assigned to Sulphur Creek, 9% were unassigned, and one each had ancestry in the Bacon and Cascade populations.
