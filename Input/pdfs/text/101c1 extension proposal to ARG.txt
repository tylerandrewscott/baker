Therefore, we believe you are proposing a 30-day extension to the final date of November 15, 2010, which the ARG had agreed to by decision on September 14th. If so, this is what we propose to do to expedite a decision. We will notice the decision today, to extend the review period deadline 30 days and completion deadline to December 15th. The ARG has two weeks from today (or by Friday, October 22) to express any opposition. We will take a preliminary thumbs up or down expression of support at the October 12 ARG conference call. If we do not hear any objections to the extension by October 22, we will execute the decision to extend. Comments in that case would be do back to PSE by December 1, 2010. The decision noticed today (October 8th): "Should the date for completion of the 101(c)1 - Sockeye Smolt Production Capacity in Baker Lake and Lake Shannon, report be extended to December 15, 2010, based on a request by members of the ARG to extend comment period by 30 days?"

Given the magnitude of this document and its relationship to fishery management issues within the Baker program, I’m requesting an extension of this review until Dec 1, 2010 (an extra 30 days). The co‐managers on the committee have initiated discussions on our review process and the schedules to accomplish this task, and it is clear that some extra time is necessary. Thanks, Jon‐Paul 10/8/2010 Draft Study Report for Baker SA 101(c)1 Sockeye Smolt Production Capacity in Baker L...
