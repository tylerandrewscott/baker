BAKER RIVER HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 10/24/2001 MEETING NOTES Baker Solution Team FERC PROJECT NO. 2150  Page 2   QUESTIONS FOR STEVE HOCKING/FERC <b7> Background (related to job) <b7> Number of years at FERC <b7> Relicensing experience <b7> Explain the licensing process (ALP/Collaborative) <b7> His role (How things might change with the application filing, etc.) <b7> How will he be involved/over what time period? Will he be with us for the long haul? <b7> What he can and can't help us with...time-wise, etc. <b7> How can we consult with him (ex-parte)? <b7> How will he coordinate with Jim Hastreiter? <b7> What has worked or not using the collaborative process? <b7> Explain FERC's decision making process. <b7> By what date the license could be issued. <b7> What types of agreements raise red flags? <b7> Perspective on how to deal with interim conditions, agreements prior to license acceptance <b7> His thoughts/experience on competitive applications. <b7> ESA: What happens if species are listed/de-listed during period of the license? <b7> Hot points FERC looks at in applications, PDEAs, etc. <b7> Feedback on Communications Protocol/Process Document <b7> How might these fly at FERC? <b7> Confidentiality Section (IV) <b7> Public Reference File <b7> How to protect information <b7> What needs to be part of the public record? Lloyd will forward this list to Steve so he can come to our November meeting fully prepared. CONFIDENTIALITY ISSUE Ed reported that attorneys for PSE and state and federal agencies (including Keith Brooks of FERC) are continuing to work out language re: How PSE can protect the confidentiality of studies-related information. The "evidence" section of Section E of the Communications Protocol will likely be removed. If the issue of confidentiality turns out to be a "show stopper," PSE may be forced to default to continue in the traditional process, in that it would provide them with the confidentiality they are seeking. We will offer mediation assistance from Rhonda Hilyer as a catalyst for the attorneys coming to resolution on this issue. REVIEW COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOL AND PROCESS DOCUMENT Members walked through both documents and made "final" changes to areas other than legal issues. These changes will be incorporated into the final documents following legal review. At our November meeting, we will review the "final" version of these documents.
