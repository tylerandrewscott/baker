This will be discussed further at the meeting September 9 UPDATE FROM JUNE BRICC MEETING Jamie and Lyn reviewed the June BRICC (Baker River Interim Coordinating Committee) meeting. Steve Hawking of FERC notified PSE that they will be issuing a DEIS - Draft Environmental Impact Statement - (as opposed to a DEA) toward the end of July. The 30-day comment period will begin when the DEIS is issued. The next BRICC meeting is August 18 to walk through the DEIS. FERC doesn’t feel this delay will impact the overall schedule. Permitting delays may delay the schedule. Connie Freeland will be setting up a meeting for various BRICC members to meet with the Town of Concrete, Skagit & Whatcom Counties, and DOE to review the contents of the Settlement Agreement in hope that this will facilitate the timely issuance of shoreline and other related permits. REVIEW TRIG NORMS The group reviewed the norms list, noting that it is a ‘living’ document that we can adjust as we go. LAND ACQUISITION UPDATE PSE has been in discussions with the Rocky Mtn. Elk Foundation re: the initial property purchase, as its primary purpose will be to provide habitat for elk. The RMEF & the Skagit Land Trust have historically dealt with permanent land protection and management. According to the license this land would only be protected for the term of the license. PSE is willing to consider many options for allocating funds in support of this license article (503). They would be willing to join a larger consortium if that would make the money go further. They just don’t want to add to the cost of the settlement. Tony then walked the group through a discussion of the RMEF partnering issues handout. Todd noted that the tribes would like to see increased integration of elk protection and support with RMEF. Implementing this license article may provide such an opportunity. Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 TRIG Meeting Notes, July 20, 2005 Page 2 of 6 We all agreed that administrative costs associated with this initial land purchase would be reimbursed to RMEF (out of the settlement pool). PSE’s internal costs will be absorbed by PSE. The aim of partnering with RMEF is to lower the cost of the land. Both Tony and Bob expressed optimism that a MOU between PSE and RMEF can be reached sometime in August. They will keep us posted. SCHEDULE UPDATE Tony reported that the schedule for 2005 is unchanged. We are on track for nearly-final drafts of management plans by the end of November 2005. The 2006 schedule will be set within one month of license issuance. TRMP REVIEW Marty walked us through the revised version of the TRMP outline (incorporating feedback from our last meeting). Chapters 1-3: He pointed out that Habitat Implementation Plans will be parcel-specific, rather than resource- or element-specific in order to more clearly outline the activities for any given piece of land. The management plan is an overview that we can update over time (we hope to do this in a way that avoids a FERC filing each time). Re: adaptive management, we’ll keep track of areas with uncertainty and address adaptive management as it becomes relevant over time. Section 2.8 – Marty suggests we change the words “the licensee” to “the TRIG” as the body which identifies suitable alternative sites or management activities. Members are to discuss this with their attorneys. Marty will insert the actual license article into section 3.1 Section 3.2 – Habitat Selection Criteria: Keep in mind that we can pick any parcel we want. We need to send folks out to scout viable parcels. These criteria aren’t hard-and-fast rules; they are guidelines to facilitate the process of identifying and prioritizing candidate parcels. Proximity to other land uses: Marty will explain here that we need to weigh the benefits and costs of protecting threatened (developed/developing) land on a parcel by parcel basis. Plants of special status: wildlife mitigation lands will be required to comply with federal laws and regulations re: protecting threatened species because these lands will be part of the FERC license. We will deal with this on a case-by-case basis. Pre-Acquisition Habitat Assessment: This is a due-diligence issue … a matter of having enough information to make an informed decision. Marty will add wording to express this intent. Pre-acquisition will include noxious weed review, which will be discussed in future meetings. Marty will add a bullet for this. Post-Acquisition Assessment: Goal is to get enough information to put together a plan that can be executed. Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 TRIG Meeting Notes, July 20, 2005 Page 3 of 6 Habitat Implementation Plan (new name): a working/living document which is prepared for each parcel or group of parcels. Chapters 1-3 Feedback / Suggested Edits: • Parcel size – in general, larger is better (10 acre or better as a threshold); small parcels should be contiguous with other protected habitat • Where/how will HEP apply? (part of baseline for management post-acquisition?) • May need to consider access for recreation (include public access considerations in plan as long as they are protective of the resource) • 3.2 – State “meet overall objectives for TRIG as stated in license article” (so we don’t re-visit TRIG objectives) Chapter 4: Changes made in chapters one through three would be carried forward. This chapter is the formula for initial acquisition and is set in the settlement agreement. Chapter 4 Feedback / Suggested Edits: • Marty will insert purpose / objective statement directly from license article in 4.1. • Insert 2 bullets from May 10 draft when fleshing out section on Access Management Chapter 5: 5.2: A wetland parcel (may not be entirely wetland) may include more buffer than we would want. Wetland Habitat Management Guidelines – Marty suggests we don’t outright prohibit any use of pesticides. Instead, we would make sure any use is legal and approved by the TRIG. Chapter 5 Feedback / Suggested Edits: • Apply DOE’s Wetland Functional Assessment as baseline • Add “locally collected” to native species on top of p. 17 Chapter 6: 6.7: Will timber harvest ever be an issue? Chapter 6 Feedback / Suggested Edits: • Suggestion to strike last two paragraphs Chapter 7: 7.7: Marty incorporated Don’s date changes with some additional requirements Chapter 11: 11.2: Added ‘non-federal.’ There was concern that there was too much detail on legacy wood. Marty will address this. 11.3: We’ll focus on non-federal lands. Though PSE will manage snags on existing as well as acquired Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 TRIG Meeting Notes, July 20, 2005 Page 4 of 6 lands, management on existing lands will be subordinate to safety and power generation-related operations. Chapters 12 &13: Lauri will give feedback on survey method to Marty for integration. Chapter 16: This is needed as a placeholder to keep this information in a separate chapter (as opposed to imbedding it in other chapters). Kathy walked us through the botanical sections (Chapters 8, 9, and 10). She went ahead and inserted the license articles into each chapter. She also put in a list of goals for those plans (interpreted from the license article by botanical teamlet members). Chapter 8: The plan will include an element of educating PSE “plant” people to be aware of new weeds such as Butterfly Bush, which may creep into the picture. She included a non-comprehensive, prioritized list (see “Draft Weed Species and Site Prioritization Worksheet” handout) of weeds to be managed. We won’t limit our management to the minimum required by state law and we recognize this list will change over time. Chapter 9: Plants of Special Status: This list will also change over time. Table 9.1 shows a list of sites. Carex flava has its own specific plan. Change 3rd column to reflect general area vs. specific GIS coordinates. Chapter 10: Carex flava: Outline with specific management objectives and actions. Contains specific adaptive management components. BOTANICAL TEAMLET Next Botanical Teamlet Meeting: August 8, 2005, from 9:30 – 12:00 in the Forest Service library NEXT STEPS TRIG will meet again September 9th to discuss the weeds on new parcels and receive an update on the elk land purchase activities. Marty will distribute the next TRMP draft by September 29th so the TRIG can meet again October 13th (sole item for the agenda: TRMP review) and have a “final” draft TRMP out by the end of November.
