They are also working on Upstream Tech Louise. Memo. Marked groups It was suggested there might be value in marked groups, not set aside for including sockeye. MWH will complete analysis with a view future to any seasonal FGE, however there is not time or money to consideration. do second study on a marked group Mary Lou's The proposed schedule for in –field biological studies were Need to Study Review: distributed for review.

Bob Barnes will determine the pool elevations to week, safely avoid a spill. Also need to include a detailed generation 2/11/02)? schedule. Ed worried about how the study and moving the sockeye around will effect their behavior. Draft report will be put out in September with progress reports along the way. Final work plan completed except transition period and dates. Far Field- Test assumes Far Field is not affected by Study prep generation being on or off. Will increase size of array at the March, study log boom.

Will be followed for duration of study, tracking them through out. Steelhead still coming into adult trap will be brought up and need to be spawned before tagged. May want 30 fish for this study. Use 75% female, and expect 50% mortality. PIT Tags Study- Propose to perform a study using PIT tags in Arnie is to order to determine the efficiency of the trap and fish guide. To examine the minimize stress, the fish will be tagged and released on same need for a day, planning on tagging about 200 a day.

PSE Presented by Dave Eales and Ron Twiner. The bid Have ready by Replacement specification for a replacement truck was distributed for Sockeye run, Fish Truck review. This truck is viewed as replacement and a very much a in May or Specification safety issue. PSE plans to obtain bids from manufactures with June. Nick proposed details, then after the bid is awarded, the will continue manufacturer is to provide specific drawings and specs, which to run specs would be available for review by agencies. The truck will be by agencies virtually the same size, with a larger tank. Hopper will be heavy than it is now, which may run the risk of overloading the trucks. Stan wants us to go ahead with bid, and update agencies with the specs. Doug mentioned that on the maintenance side, it is much better to have new truck and new tanks. Review List of Mort reviewed format, which will be used in the rest of the Filter #1 process. It will contain background, description, design Alternatives criteria, layout of the ladder and alternative's analysis based on discussions. Draft will be cleaned up, impute added, and sent out. U1.2 has a fixed pool. Don Schluter does not agree to decision at the previous upstream passage meeting to consider fish ladders as a fatally flawed alternative for upstream passage. He objects to the handling of the fish that other options entail and requires volitional passage. Gary asked Don to again review the documented concerns of fish ladders. Don stated that he believes the ladders could be built up the side of the dam, and does not see landslides, or previous failures of large ladders, as a reason to eliminate this alternative. Mort, Ed & Jim consider ladders of this size a detriment to the fish passage, with a high likelihood of harm to the fish. Don also believes some type of new technology would provide a means for ladder construction. It was pointed out that other options, such as a fish tram, are still being considered. As no agreement was 3 reached on this issue Don and others agreed to discuss this issue at the Solution Team level. Review List of Locks, elevators and tramways alternatives were reviewed at Filter #2 the conceptual level, with examples of such facilities being Alternatives presented. Elevators are designed for upstream passage; not downstream passage Pelton Round Butte Dam has tramway that is being studied. Sorting capabilities are more difficult with such a facility, however this option should not be listed as fatally flawed for this reason. Since existing examples of this type of facility are on smaller structures, scaling issues to the size of the Baker structures must be considered Temperature Temperature data at various locations at the Baker facility was Sampling distributed. This hourly data is summarized to daily averages Summary and then compared to the adult trap to determine the amount of temperature differences between the trap and other release locations. Erroneous information is present due to dry temperature sensors. Since transport time is short, 45 minutes, so there is little temperature increase during transport. Jim suggested finding maximum temperature days and using these for a basis of comparison. Project Schedule now includes the study dates. Upstream resolution Schedule by middle 2003. Up and downstream are now moving along nicely, however overall schedule will require New Action Items: • Take a video of trap operation - Doug Bruland • Consider placing this video and/or pictures of trap operation on website • Ongoing resolution of temperature and flow study - Kim • Sorting Adult Fish & number of containers needed – Nick • Email Upstream Passage Matrix - Kim March 6th Agenda • Review notes • Action Items • Studies Schedule Refined • Discussion on trams, elevators alternatives • Project schedule • Set agenda next meeting 4 5
