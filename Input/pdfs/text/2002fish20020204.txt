MWH will examine the data for correlation to natural and operation variables. They are also working on Upstream Tech Memo. It was suggested there might be value in marked groups, not including sockeye. MWH will complete analysis with a view to any seasonal FGE, however there is not time or money to do second study on a marked group Mary Lou's The proposed schedule for in –field biological studies were Study Review: distributed for review. The schedule provided date of handout was release, number and type of fish / tagging and release given out. location.  ACTION BY Data analysis ongoing – MWH; Mary Louise. Marked groups set aside for future consideration.

This study measures depth of fish with generation plan, with a on & off. Study reduces variables. The effect of the b baffles field trip to is not a study goal, so they will remain fully open.

Bob Barnes will determine the pool elevations to week, safely avoid a spill. Also need to include a detailed generation 2/11/02)? schedule. Ed worried about how the study and moving the sockeye around will effect their behavior. Draft report will be put out in September with progress reports along the way. Final work plan completed except transition period and dates. Far Field- Test assumes Far Field is not affected by Study prep generation being on or off.

Will be followed for duration of study, tracking them through out. Steelhead still coming into adult trap will be brought up and need to be spawned before tagged. May want 30 fish for this study. Use 75% female, and expect 50% mortality. PIT Tags Study- Propose to perform a study using PIT tags in order to determine the efficiency of the trap and fish guide. To minimize stress, the fish will be tagged and released on same day, planning on tagging about 200 a day. Draft report due out in October.  PSE Replacement Fish Truck Specification  Review List of Filter #1 Alternatives  Additional comments on studies: Mary Lou will keep in touch while studies are going on, and will call in people if results are not what is expected.. Presented by Dave Eales and Ron Twiner. The bid specification for a replacement truck was distributed for review. This truck is viewed as replacement and a very much a safety issue. PSE plans to obtain bids from manufactures with proposed details, then after the bid is awarded, the manufacturer is to provide specific drawings and specs, which would be available for review by agencies. The truck will be virtually the same size, with a larger tank. Hopper will be heavy than it is now, which may run the risk of overloading the trucks. Stan wants us to go ahead with bid, and update agencies with the specs. Doug mentioned that on the maintenance side, it is much better to have new truck and new tanks. Mort reviewed format, which will be used in the rest of the process. It will contain background, description, design criteria, layout of the ladder and alternative's analysis based on discussions. Draft will be cleaned up, impute added, and sent out. U1.2 has a fixed pool. Don Schluter does not agree to decision at the previous upstream passage meeting to consider fish ladders as a fatally flawed alternative for upstream passage. He objects to the handling of the fish that other options entail and requires volitional passage. Gary asked Don to again review the documented concerns of fish ladders. Don stated that he believes the ladders could be built up the side of the dam, and does not see landslides, or previous failures of large ladders, as a reason to eliminate this alternative. Mort, Ed & Jim consider ladders of this size a detriment to the fish passage, with a high likelihood of harm to the fish. Don also believes some type of new technology would provide a means for ladder construction. It was pointed out that other options, such as a fish tram, are still being considered. As no agreement was  3  Arnie is to examine the need for a collection permit. and if required to submit an application. Have ready by Sockeye run, in May or June. Nick will continue to run specs by agencies   Review List of Filter #2 Alternatives  Temperature Sampling Summary  Project Schedule  reached on this issue Don and others agreed to discuss this issue at the Solution Team level. Locks, elevators and tramways alternatives were reviewed at the conceptual level, with examples of such facilities being presented. Elevators are designed for upstream passage; not downstream passage Pelton Round Butte Dam has tramway that is being studied. Sorting capabilities are more difficult with such a facility, however this option should not be listed as fatally flawed for this reason. Since existing examples of this type of facility are on smaller structures, scaling issues to the size of the Baker structures must be considered Temperature data at various locations at the Baker facility was distributed. This hourly data is summarized to daily averages and then compared to the adult trap to determine the amount of temperature differences between the trap and other release locations. Erroneous information is present due to dry temperature sensors. Since transport time is short, 45 minutes, so there is little temperature increase during transport. Jim suggested finding maximum temperature days and using these for a basis of comparison. Schedule now includes the study dates. Upstream resolution by middle 2003. Up and downstream are now moving along nicely, however overall schedule will require  New Action Items: • Take a video of trap operation - Doug Bruland • Consider placing this video and/or pictures of trap operation on website • Ongoing resolution of temperature and flow study - Kim • Sorting Adult Fish & number of containers needed – Nick • Email Upstream Passage Matrix - Kim March 6th Agenda • Review notes • Action Items • Studies Schedule Refined • Discussion on trams, elevators alternatives • Project schedule • Set agenda next meeting  4   5    2002fish20020204.pdf en
