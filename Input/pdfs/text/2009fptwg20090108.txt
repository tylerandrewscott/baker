Meeting Notes – Baker River Basin Native Char Consultation Fish Passage Technical Working Group (FPTWG)  Project:  Baker River Project FERC No. 2150  Written By:  Phil Hilgert, R2 Resource Consultants  Meeting Date:  January, 2009 (Thu.), 9:30 a.m. – noon  Location:  USFWS Office, Lacey, WA  Attendees:  Doug Bruland, PSE Jeff Chan, USFWS Cary Feldmann, PSE Denise Hawkins, USFWS  Purpose:  Review 2008 genetic analysis of tissue samples and coordinate 2009 activities.  Phil Hilgert, R2 LouEllyn Jones, USFWS Maureen “Mo” Small, WDFW (by phone) Nick Verretto, PSE  Generally following the agenda (attachment 1), the group reviewed the Project layout and pre-licensing studies(attachment 2), License articles affecting bull trout handling, and a summary of char captures and handling in 2008. During 2008, WDFW analyzed tissue samples from char captured in the Baker River basin (attachment 3) to evaluate potential genetic differences. Mo Small discussed the results of the genetic analysis report (Version 12/23/08) and explained the figures and tables included in the report: Results of WDFW Genetic Analysis  239 samples analyzed - consisting of juveniles captured in the Upper Baker River basin, Sulphur Creek and Baker Lake/Lake Shannon downstream fish passage facilities, and adults captured at the Lower Baker adult trap; no other bull trout samples from the Baker River were analyzed in 2008.  Juvenile samples from Sulphur Creek and Upper Baker River Basin represented two reproductively isolated populations.  Adult bull trout captured at the Lower Baker adult trap originated from the Upper Baker River, Sulphur, Illabot or Sauk populations.  Adult bull trout originating from the Baker basin outnumber out-of-basin adults during June, July and August at the Lower Baker adult trap; out-of-basin adults outnumber Baker basin fish during the other months. Baker River Hydroelectric Project, FERC Nos. P-2150-033, 027 Filename : Meeting notes native char mtg_010809.doc  1 of 7     Two juvenile char captured at the Lake Shannon downstream fish passage facility were tentatively identified as Dolly Varden or brook trout (no baseline data available).  In response to comments regarding Figure 6 and Appendix 1 in the December 23, 2008 report, Mo agreed to reorder the sample groups by geographic capture location in an approximate downstream to upstream order (see Table 1). Mo will prepare a revised version of the report with the version date noted on the cover sheet and in the filename. Although the results of the genetic analysis will not change, the group thought that re-ordering the sample groups may make it easier to discern and describe patterns in genetic assignments.

Capture data similar to that recorded for bull trout will be recorded for the brook trout tissue samples (for example, capture location, length, weight). Capture by angling, measure/PIT tag/release near point of capture adult char at Upper Baker FSC and Lower Baker gulper, angling will be opportunistic and is expected to be conducted during downstream fish passage monitoring studies Transport and release char according to proposed handling protocols (intent is to decrease the number of out-of-basin char transported and released into Baker Lake)  Jeff Chan requested that if there is an opportunity, the USFWS and WDFW would appreciate having 3040 tissue samples collected from juvenile native char from Park and Swift creeks. Phil mentioned the glacial nature of Park Creek and noted that opportunities for clear water conducive to capturing juvenile char by electrofishing are infrequent; PSE did not commit to providing the samples. Potential handling protocols were discussed and the group agreed to the following list of protocols for 2009. Next winter, the protocols will be revisited after the results of genetic analysis of the remaining bull trout tissue samples are available. 2009 Baker River Basin Native Char Handling Protocols  Lower Baker adult trap sub-adults/adults (>150 mm): measure, tissue sample, interrogate if PIT tagged, transport and release into Baker Lake or Lake Shannon depending on tag information.  Lower Baker adult trap sub-adults/adults (>150 mm): measure, tissue sample, if not tagged, PIT tag and release into Skagit River (priority of release sites: (1)Hamilton, (2)Faber Landing, (3) mouth of Baker River), if the adult char re-enter the trap a second time, transport upstream and release into Baker Lake.  Lower Baker adult trap juveniles (<150 mm): measure, tissue sample, PIT tag and release downstream in the Skagit River, continue to release juvenile recaptures into the Skagit River.  Baker Lake and Lake Shannon FSC juveniles and sub-adults (< 300 mm): measure, tissue sample, PIT tag and release downstream.  Adults captured in Baker Lake or Lake Shannon (>300 mm): measure, interrogate if PIT tagged, otherwise PIT tag, and release near point of capture.

Baker River Basin Native Char Investigations 9:30 a.m. – noon, January 8, 2009 Room 133, USFWS Office, Lacey, WA AGENDA  1. Review Project Features and Previous Relicensing Study Efforts  Floy-tag adults at Lower Baker River upstream fish passage facility  Baker Basin tributary study (production potential)  Snorkel surveys in Sulphur Creek and Upper Baker River  Electrofishing/snorkel surveys in Lake Shannon tributaries (WRIA .0451, .0439 and Rocky Creek) 2. Review Decision Process for License Article 103 (Upstream Fish Passage Facility)  Review License Article and current schedule  Review options to reduce the number of out-of-basin char transported and released upstream into Baker Basin 3. Review Decision Process for License Article 104 (Connectivity)  Review License Article and current schedule  Juvenile bull trout captured in Sulphur Creek apparently exhibit a genetic signature that has persisted over decades of ongoing transport and release protocols. Review how the results of the genetics analysis affect implementation of Article 104. 4. Review License Article 410 (Threatened, Endangered and Sensitive Species Plan) 5.

A dash indicates no sampling effort, a zero indicates sampling effort but no tissue samples collected. 3 Amplification failed in a contiguous block of samples 2-18 from Pass Creek (n=17); amplification was successful on other Pass Creek samples. The failure of the block of samples is unexplained. 4 During 2007, tissue samples were collected from 19 juveniles and 30 sub-adults, 2008 tissue samples were collected from 7 juveniles and 9 sub-adults. 5 One juvenile char (150 mm) was captured in the Lower Baker upstream fish passage facility, transported upstream, and released into Baker Lake in 2008. * Samples analyzed by WDFW (n=239) 2  Baker River Hydroelectric Project, FERC Nos.
