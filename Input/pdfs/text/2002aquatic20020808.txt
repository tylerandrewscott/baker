REVIEW RE-LICENSE SCHEDULE Arnie distributed updated copies of the relicensing schedule an the schedule for specific aquatics studies that are underway. We will review these timelines at the start of each Working Group meeting. SETTLEMENT PROCESS - PMEs SCOPING Dee distributed a matrix and reviewed with us the work completed by the Aquatics Settlement teamlet August 5. They boiled the issues down to three broad questions with many subcategories under each. The questions are: 1. What can we do to address Project influences on natural processes and functions? 2. What can we do to address Project influences on aquatics and terrestrial community composition and productivity (presence, abundance and structure)? 3. What can we do to address Project effects on aquatic and riparian habitat? The teamlet brainstormed a preliminary list of potential PMEs for each. We reviewed the list and added some additional ideas: Under Productivity we added: • Add recreational fishing (along with /NA harvest) #79. • Re: hatcheries, include all native species Baker River Project Relicense 2 of 11 Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 8-8-02_Final_fishWG_notes; Lyn Wiltse • Restore spawning beaches 1-3 to natural condition • #67: change “combination” to “contribution” Under Flows we added: • Establish appropriate minimum flows (to meet specific species needs). • Look for opportunities to create new off channel habitat • # 5: change “endangers” to “endangered” – aquatic species (mostly fish) • Provide mitigation water for downstream water supply. Under Upstream Passage we added: • Consider not allowing chinook passage to Upper Baker (up stream passage) Under Ramping we added: • #24: Reference (WDFW) (Hunter et al”) Under Reservoir Operations we added: • #24: Manage reservoir to meet flow and ramping requirements • Large woody debris • #39 change “wood” to “log jams” • #44: Consider impact of large woody debris being an obstacle to bridges downstream • #42 (navigation hazard on reservoir, maybe Skagit River. Water Quality: • Meet State Water Quality Standards • Preserve beneficial uses • Adhere to anti degradation policy • Influence modification of State rules for sufficient nutrients We reviewed the draft of criteria that the Solution Team suggested for narrowing options for PMEs. We will ask the Solution Team to re-title the list “Defining a Range of Options”. We also suggest adding a 3rd mandatory criteria which would be “technically feasible.” We seem to be well on our way toward meeting the Solution Team’s request to have a very preliminary draft of PMEs including areas where we need more information before we can even guess at potential PMEs. The Solution Team has moved their October meeting to the 30th to give all Working Groups as much time as possible to come up with their lists. Next Steps – The Technical Working Group will finish brainstorming on August 23 and send updated matrix out to Working Group members to review and send additions to Arnie. We will begin to narrow the list in September. IPP UPDATE Sue reported that PSE is implementing the IPP. This is affecting flows. We will get a detailed update at our September meeting. Baker River Project Relicense 3 of 11 Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 8-8-02_Final_fishWG_notes; Lyn Wiltse REPORT FROM INSTREAM FLOWS TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP Sue reviewed the components of the Instream Flow Model (A-9). Her PowerPoint presentation will be available on the web. She also distributed a written progress report on A9. (See matrix below).

A09A Skagit River Flow and Habitat The teamlet has come to agreement on a Assessment (HIGH PRIORITY) general modeling approach. They are now focusing on transect selection. They started by breaking the mainstream channel into sections by channel pattern. They have identified preliminary locations for 24 transects. There will be a field trip to review these proposed locations August 16. It was noted that it is important that we take into consideration previous studies on flows (depth of river at various locations) (e.g., 1911 study done by the Corp), so we have data to help us predict likely flow patterns over the period of the license. Sue assured us that these were being taken into consideration in assessing this very complex system. The plan is to model up to 50Kcfs. We will be collecting field data at levels: 7Kcfs, 14Kcfs, and 20Kcfs. Sue reported they are starting to re-think their original idea of trying to do in stream flow modeling in side channels since only 2 of the 28 were wet at less than 14Kcfs. Baker River Project Relicense 4 of 11 Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 8-8-02_Final_fishWG_notes; Lyn Wiltse It will be pretty much impossible to isolate Project effects on ground water in sloughs. They will be better able to understand Project effects in side channels. They will revisit all side channel inlets at 7Kcfs and predict connectivity at 7 side channels using steady flow model and mainstream transect data. They will map the wetted area of 6 sloughs at all 3 flow elevations. ACTIVE Next steps for 2003 survey: • August 16 = Instream Flow Technical Subcommittee field trip to finalize transects • August 27-30 collect mainstem depth and velocity data at 14, 0000 cfs (tentative) • If flows attain 21, 000 cfs in next two weeks, conduct initial slough surveys • Purchase and install 3 submersible pressure transducer stage recorders to support development of unsteady flow model. A09B Salmonid Redd Selection and There has been no movement on this since Maintenance in the Middle Skagit in Stan submitted it. Stan and Gary will follow Response to River Fluctuation from up with Phil re: suggested methodology. Hydropower Peaking ACTIVE? A09C Distribution, Timing and Depth of Adam Weybright (R2) had prepared a Salmonid Redds PowerPoint slide show that summarized the results of the 2002 steelhead surveys. Phil walked us through the results of that survey. Visibility was a challenge during the spring. We will look at integrating tributary spawning data (WDFW) on timing and distribution into the final report. For the fall 2002, Phil suggests 3 levels of survey effort: aerial, jet boat, and a combination platter (“full meal deal” which includes all of the above plus a cat-a-raft). He distributed a proposal that included the timing and estimated costs associated with each level. If differences in spawning from Hamilton to Concrete and Hamilton to Sedro-Woolley are noted, we would expand the survey effort accordingly. Phil agreed to add a “full meal deal” in December. If a lot of redds are observed (defined as 20-30), the survey effort will be expanded to measure characteristics of those redds. Question for fall survey: Do we Baker River Project Relicense 5 of 11 Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 8-8-02_Final_fishWG_notes; Lyn Wiltse measure redds between Baker and the Sauk? ACTIVE A09D Distribution, Timing of Salmonid Fry We just got the NMFS collection permit (August 2002). ACTIVE A10 Baker River Delta Habitat Assessment- Complete.

A12 Instream Flows for Bio-diversity Split between R-A21 & R-A09. A13A Water Quality Impacts of Human Uses Removed from list of studies we will address. of the Reservoir and Adjacent Shorelines Brady reported USFS will not pursue this. A13B Water Quality Impacts on Aquatic Removed from list of studies we will address. Habitat Brady reported USFS will not pursue this. A14A Reservoir Shoreline Erosion We will get an update on this at our September meeting. ACTIVE A15 UB Delta Scour Sue walked us through a Power Point presentation of this study. This will be available on the web. Five times between 9/18 and 10/30 of 2001 they mapped Redds on the delta. They collected GPS data on Redd locations and recorded species and depth for each. They also installed 19 scour monitors and did repeat cross-section surveys for each monitor/set of monitors. We feel like we have a pretty comprehensive set of data for 2001 Redd distribution. There were a total of 726, with half in Channel Creek, just over 20% on Delta Right an nearly as many on Delta Left. 10% were in the Baker River and tribs. These data map well with historic data. ACTIVE Note: Lake tribs may be under-represented as visibility was a problem. Proposed 2002 mapping: • Survey residualized sockeye in Lake • Survey for other species? Chinook, Bull trout, and Coho? • There may be overlap with A1B Proposed 2002 scour monitor efforts: • Install scour monitors only near full pool elevation prior to drawdown • Install stable headpins and survey transects at approximately 5 -ft elevation intervals across delta right and delta left channels (720-700 ft MSL) Baker River Project Relicense 6 of 11 Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 8-8-02_Final_fishWG_notes; Lyn Wiltse • Repeat surveys at approximately 2 week intervals from Sept. thru Nov., and thereafter as accessible through March A16 Lower Baker River Alluvial Fan Follows on heels of A24. Sue will give us an Assessment update on this at our September meeting. ACTIVE A17 Tributaries Surveys Upstream of Study request pending from USFS. This is Barriers related to A36. Brady is in the process of re- working it. A18 Baker River Survey Upstream of 1 km. Merged into A01a and A01b. ACTIVE. A19 Review Limnological Information This study has been combined with A26. A20 Large Woody Debris Management ACTIVE A21 Skagit Wild & Scenic River Values Removed from list of studies we will address. Brady reported USFS will not pursue this as it is being addressed by A9 and A24. A22 Baker Lake Trout Impacts Evaluation No longer necessary due to change in management direction in favor of cancellation of non-native trout stocking in the reservoirs. Removed from list of studies we will consider. A23 Baker River Wild & Scenic River Removed from list of studies we will address. Values Brady reported USFS will not pursue this as it is being addressed through other studies, i.e. A15. A24 Hydrologic and Geomorphic Analysis ACTIVE A25 Unnatural Predation Nick distributed a July 5 draft of the study plan put together by Carl Hadley. All were asked to review the plan for discussion at our September meeting. ACTIVE A26A Reservoir Limnology-Production This study is specific to the reservoir. Nick, Potential Phil, Stan, Gary met to outline the goals of this study: 1. Sockeye and coho production potential – 2 numbers (range) 2. Limiting factor for sockeye and coho, quantify 3. Anything jump out as limiting to other species 4. Potential benefits of reservoir fertilization 5. Identify Project effects which affect production 6. Data gaps, proposal to fill them By early September, Nick will share list of possible consultants with this teamlet to review. Still in the process of consolidating Baker River Project Relicense 7 of 11 Fish and Aquatic Resources Working Group File: 8-8-02_Final_fishWG_notes; Lyn Wiltse the scale data and a variety of other limnology/water quality-related data and maps. Also looking at temperature data, juvenile outmigration data, ICD, any other related data that will help the consultant gain a quick understanding of where we are. We hope to have the consultant on board by mid- September. Brady suggested that where possible, we look at also addressing other native species (includes non-salmonids). The main priority is to get a study plan together that addresses sockeye and coho. ACTIVE A26B Tributary Production Potential Brady suggested that where possible, we look at also addressing other native species (includes non-salmonids). The main priority is to get a study plan together that addresses sockeye and coho. Linked with A01b and A01b. ACTIVE A27 Middle Skagit Incubation Flows Addressed in A9. A28 Fish Passage-Reservoir Management This is being developed in the Fish Passage Technical Working Group. ACTIVE A29 Estimate Sockeye Production from Nick distributed a slightly fleshed out version Different Incubation Sources of the bulleted list we came up with this Study. Results so far: Sampling found fish (many coho, no sockeye) in channel creek and Beaches 3&4. All were asked to review this draft study plan and be ready to discuss at our September meeting. Gary suggested we may want to sample also in Sulphur Creek. Nick expressed serious reservations about the amount/validity of the data we would get from this survey and how we would use it.

Brady is working with Assessments WDFW to rework this. R-A37 Without Project Alternative (evaluation Brady has incorporated the comments he of Aquatic & Riparian Habitat) received into the current version of the Study Request. Though efforts will be made to integrate this study with the Terrestrial Working Group study, it appears that they are too far along on this for us to work with them. We need to address without Project as a NEPA requirement. There are questions around the scope of the study and how the data from the study would be used. NOTE: We should make an assumption re: the manner in which the Project might be removed as this would influence what resources would be there over the term of the next license. It was also suggested that a historical look wouldn’t necessarily be a predictor of what would be there in the future (in terms of aquatic resources). We would be able to guess at gradient and width of streams. The purpose of this study is to predict potential of what could be there without Project. We need to have a lot of off-line chats on this before we discuss again at our September meeting.
