Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 ARG Final Meeting Notes, July 10, 2007 Page 1 of 5 FISH FACILITIES OPERATIONAL TOPICS Juvenile Fish Passage Facilities Operations Doug walked the group through the current juvenile fish passage numbers. This was not a big year for sockeye (especially compared to last year). Upper Baker: We had about 81k no-mark sockeye return, and an additional 30k fall released ad-clipped sockeye. At Lower Baker we recovered 18k fall no mark sockeye from Lower Baker. Branded groups percent recovery is pretty good. At UB 50.8% Left V brand Coho and 47 % Right V brand Coho were recovered so far. 4.9 % of the branded fish released at Upper Baker were recovered at Lower Baker. We had 33.5% recovery of the freeze-branded fish released in Lake Shannon, which is the best percent recovery we’ve seen at Lower Baker in the last six years. We should be getting a better idea of what a migrant is as a result of the biological data (currently being analyzed in Oregon). These data will be released to R2 for processing / analysis. Juvenile Chinook numbers are down. Also we are not getting the numbers of sockeye fry; they are coming later and the numbers are low. We noted that there are many variables that may contribute to this, and speculated that when the new FSC is up and running, the screens will be better able to collect fry (keeping them from going through pumps). We are continuing to fish the juvenile trap through July. There is no gravity flow through it at this point, are using pumps. Everything we see today should be different next year: new guide nets, new trap, new FSC! Sockeye Spawning Beaches 3 & 4, and Artificial Incubation Ops Kevin noted that we still can’t get to Beach 3. The access road is impassable with anything but a tracked vehicle. The Forest Service has made some road material available. Beach 4 disinfection went well, gravel was clean, and we’re back online. There were two counter head failures (not repairable); these will be replaced in advance of this year’s out-migration. As of July 9, we’ve had 875 adult Sockeye return. We are at the mid-season point and the updated prediction for this year is between 4,800 and 6,000. Artificial Incubation The co-managers agreed to fill up everything except the coho stacks. Looks like we have the capacity for between 1.8 and 2 million eyed eggs (if we get the fish). Kevin shared that he’s been sitting in on the hatchery meetings, is coordinating between PSE and Fish Pro, and reported that process is moving along well. He is also working with Scott Lentz to figure out how to access Channel Creek for fry release. Fish Rearing Inventories and Releases Doug walked us through the trout planting and salmon planting history handouts. Rainbow trout, coho and sockeye are released in stages. There is a new brood stock at the hatchery now. Trout: We get 21k fish, first 1,000 went to the tribes, we then released the rest of last year’s fish into Depression Lake. PSE’s annual Troutfest occurred June 9; good event, well attended. We have 350 rainbow trout left, being retained at this point for Cascade Days and the Eagle Club fishing derbies. Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 ARG Final Meeting Notes, July 10, 2007 Page 2 of 5 Released coho at Skagit River. All freeze brand, ad-clipped and study group fish were released. The Baker project fish inventory handout detailed the sockeye, coho and rainbow releases. 65k Sockeye will be ad- lipped in September and released in October. Remaining fish will be marked for studies. 60k coho – which is enough for our program. Rainbow trout were received in June, are now split into three circular ponds and will be reared throughout the year (release some in the fall, save others for studies, release the rest in the spring). If we start the construction at the hatchery next year, some of these fish will be on site. We’ll need to decide when to release these fish and how to handle next year’s brood during the construction phase. Adult Trap Protocol No changes at this time. BRICC / LICENSING UPDATE USFW submitted their Biological Opinion (BiOp) a couple weeks ago; still awaiting the BiOp from NMFS. FERC will not issue the license until they receive that BiOp. We are now thinking it may be the end of October before they issue the new license. In the meantime, early implementation activities are continuing in order to be ready when the license is issued. (Ex: the terrestrial group is working on acquiring elk property). The Town of Concrete issued a construction permit. The Department of Ecology has issued the 401 and CZMA consistency plan. Concrete’s permitting process, as well as the 401, was appealed by Diking Districts 2 and 12, and the cities of Burlington and Mt. Vernon. The court date is set for November; these legal proceedings should not affect license issuance. The June Baker River Interim Coordinating Committee (BRICC) was cancelled. The next meeting is currently scheduled for August 22 in Mountlake Terrace. INSTREAM FLOW REPORT Phil presented the long-awaited report at the ARG’s May meeting. Arnie and Phil asked folks to review and provide feedback, and Phil shared that his first bit of feedback came in this morning. It is a hefty report and many participants noted that they haven’t had time to review it in detail. We asked that attendees send any questions or comments to Phil via Arnie, and agreed to set the cut-off date for review and input at September 11, 2007. All agreed upon the value of the data in this report. One attendee noted: “This plus the scenarios we ran through HYDROPS are what got us to settlement.” It was suggested we add a blurb to the report acknowledging potential flow changes as a result of climate change (reference to the report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). Any changes are more likely to result in timing differences than flow volumes. We noted that the flow agreement includes contingencies for high and low flows and outlines resulting procedural changes. Phil pointed out that section 7.3.4 of the report addresses what PSE’s response would be to various changes to reservoir inflow. We have built buffers into the reservoir pool levels far beyond what we would expect to need, including Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 ARG Final Meeting Notes, July 10, 2007 Page 3 of 5 results of minor climate change. Any catastrophic climate changes would be dealt with through adaptive management. Other suggestions included to clarify the aim of the report in the executive summary and add a list of acronyms. HATCHERY DESIGN UPDATE Dave J. (project manager, PSE) gave the group an update of progress on the hatchery project. We are expecting final design from HDR shortly, and will be issuing the RFP early next week. PSE is planning to engage in a design/build contract. They sent out a request for qualifications and had four well-qualified teams respond: MWH, McDougal (FSC builders), KCM/Tetratek, and ESM. These firms all have experience with sockeye hatcheries. They would also prefer the contractor have hatchery experience. Work plans should impede current fish operations as little as possible. Should get proposals back by the end of August and be able to select a contractor in early September (hopefully in time for the Sept. 11 meeting). Dave estimates the 30% design to be available November/December 2007 and 60% design by the end of 2007. We’ll have another Value Engineering (VE) session at that point, and the ARG requested an opportunity to review the design and provide input both before and after that process (at the 30% and after the VE review). We will aim to extend the November 13 ARG meeting to all-day to allow for hatchery design review and discussion. We will do the same at our Jan/Feb 2008 ARG meeting to allow for a review of the 60% post-VE design. We should be at 90% design by February 2008. Construction would then be able to start in March or April 2008, pending issuance of the license from FERC and special use permit from USFS. The aim would be to have the adult raceways up and running by spring 2009; and we should have a fully operational facility by 2010. Dave shared the current site plan and noted that the design has changed very little since the last report to this group. We discussed timing issues relative to operations and contingency planning, such as keeping eggs separated, using alternate methods, and ensuring that construction phases align with )don’t negatively impact) fish operations. Next steps: getting a Hydraulic Project Approval (HPA) from WDFW and other permits from Whatcom County. FISH PASSAGE TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP UPDATE Jacob reported that the FSC construction is proceeding on schedule. The July 17th FPTWG meeting has been moved to the FSC (originally scheduled in Sea-Tac) to allow the team to see how the screens fit, etc. HANDOUTS Agenda & Notes ARG Baker River Project Long Term Planning Schedule (July 2007) ARG Baker River Project Long Term Planning Schedule (June 18, 2007) Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 ARG Final Meeting Notes, July 10, 2007 Page 4 of 5 Baker Beaches Arrival and Disposition Trout Planting History ARG Status Report: Baker Fish Operation Topics, Relicensing, and Implementation Activities (June 12, 2007) Baker Project Fish Inventory (July 9, 2007) PSE Baker Project Salmon Planting History (1983 – 2007) 2007 Upper Baker Available Fish Trap Data 2007 2007 Lower Baker Juvenile Fish Trap Data 2007 Little Park out-migrants 2002 Baker Fish Hatchery Renovation Overall Site Plan (June 19, 2007) MEETING EVALUATION What Went Well Got out early Adequate facilitation Very pun-ny!

We seem to have passed the peak time as the numbers have dropped down considerably, but we will continue to capture fish until the first week in August. Summarizing the migration test groups; through early June, 50.5 % of the freeze branded Coho released at Blue tarp fish release site (located at the upper end of Baker Lake) and 45.8% of the freezebranded Coho released at West Pass Dike (lower end) have been captured at the Upper Baker juvenile trap, and 41.8% of the freeze branded Sockeye smolts released at Blue tarp have been captured at the Upper Baker trap. PSE has also been sampling the Little Park juvenile smolt trap. So far, 3,200 Coho smolts have been captured in the Little Park Creek trap. Most had a portion of their top caudal fin removed for monitoring recapture at the Upper Baker gulper/trap. In-season recapture data is preliminary and estimated over 35%. The Little Park smolt trap is scheduled for removal shortly after Coho numbers drop off, expected to be after mid-June. To date, we have captured about 28,700 total juvenile fish (18,700 unmarked sockeye; 1,900 marked sockeye; 6,100 unmarked coho; 1,900 marked coho; 100 other fish) at the Lower Baker gulper/trap. Approximately, 31.5% of the freeze branded Coho (these are released at the upper end of Lake Shannon) have been captured; as well as 4.1 % of the Baker released freeze branded Coho and 7% of the Baker released branded Sockeye. These are higher levels of freeze branded Baker Lake fish captured at Lower Baker; we are uncertain why. FSC construction work is being conducted in the UB forebay, requiring frequent short term lowering of the guide net to allow equipment to be transported to the dam. Draft daily records are available by contacting Doug Bruland (360-853-8341, ext.3020). The final data sheets will be presented to the ARG at the end of the 2007 migration season. In-Season Biological Studies Progress: This study effort is in coordination with the Fish Passage Technical Working Group and is in it’s 2nd year of supporting development of techniques for assessing future FSC performance. Test fish groups have been released during the migration season. On June 6th , PSE released the 7th group of PIT tagged Coho and Sockeye from our net pens to the upper forebay. That is our last large scheduled release for the biological study this spring. We will continue to collect weekly samples of gill tissue from net pen controls through July in addition to the normal gill tissue and other data collected from recaptured study. Gill tissues are sent off to Oregon for analysis. Preliminary study results are not available at this time. Results of this study are being discussed at FPTWG meetings, the next on July 17th. Sockeye Spawning Beach Final Fry Counts: Kevin Kurras (WDFW) provided this summary along with the data attachments included with this update: ARG Status Report 1 June 12, 2007 Fry Information Final fry numbers follow: 4A 222,175 4B 498,792 4C 905,245 4D 45,368 Hopper (number used for plants reports) 1,990,063 As you can see from the “fry production spreadsheet”, we had questionable counts. I am working with Smith-Root to try to resolve this issue. Apparently, the counting tunnels degrade over time in this water and give erroneous data. I believe that we planted more than the hopper number but I am not able to quantify the true amount. The counter and the tunnel from 4D are at the manufacturer now and I am waiting for the disposition. We do have a loaner tunnel and we may purchase one other to try to fix the situation. I have also included the “Sockeye Data Sheet” which gives a breakdown by section of adults, spawners and other info. Sockeye Spawning Beach Operations and Maintenance: Kevin Kurras (WDFW) provided this summary of recent news and maintenance conducted during the traditional shutdown period at the spawning beach: Beach 4 -Maintenance is proceeding and no major problems have been observed. There is a hole in the curtain between sections C and D that we will try to repair again this year. Before going back online, we will flush the cages at the headworks, but we will wait until after “Trout Fest” and the remaining rainbow are consolidated. Beach 3 -The road is open to the gate into beach 3, however the road beyond the gate is in very poor condition. Several hundred yards was washed away and in several places the road bed is gone. I had Doug Koens look at it and in his opinion it will require some major cat work along with some 4-6 inch rock and a like amount of 11/4 inch gravel to cover. We can get a close estimate when we need it. There is no visible damage to the headworks, the buildings, or beach #3. At this point there is no vehicle access into the beach. The main river channel looks to still be on the east side of the delta with a small side channel carrying two to three inches of flow along the rip rap by the road. Did I mention mosquitoes? Coho- It was agreed that the “surplus” coho fry will be released into Lake Shannon when temperatures are acceptable. I informed Doug Bruland. 2007 Sockeye Beach Loading and Artificial Incubation: Kevin Kurras (WDFW) provided this update: Beach Loadings At this time the co-managers are still discussing the loadings for this year. I will contact Arnie with the loading plan when it becomes available. Fish Rearing Inventory: Doug provided this table on the fish inventory at the Upper Baker Rearing Facility: ARG Status Report 2 June 12, 2007 BAKER PROJECT FISH INVENTORY Inventory date:June 8th, 2007 brood planned release date and location Species year population fish/lb Pounds location comments 67,786 to be released @ Baker Lake ( Blue tarp ) by mid June 2007.

They are proposing to run a pilot study in 2007, involving monitoring the adult trap for tagged sockeye that are part of the tag and release fishery conducted in the Skagit River. Questions about the study can be addressed by contacting Jon-Paul Shannahan of the Upper Skagit Tribe (360-854-7089). Adult trap maintenance Adult trap annual maintenance was conducted from April 18th to May 1st 2007. During this time the trap was drained, pressure washed, fittings were greased, rocks removed from the entrance weir, and minor repairs were performed where needed. No major repairs were necessary. Baker Relicense Activities Draft A-09 Instream Flow Summary Report: The Draft report was distributed at the May 8, 2007 ARG meeting and feedback was requested in the next 60 days. Comments can be submitted to Arnie. Phil Hilgert discussed how the report was organized and how it documents the process and thinking behind the flow plan agreed in the Settlement Agreement. So far, we have not received any comments on the draft report. We are anticipating having time at the July ARG meeting for discussing comments. Baker Implementation Activities SA Article 101 Hatchery: Design of the hatchery will be continuing to a near final stage this fall and early winter under the arrangement of a design-build contractor. Request for proposals from four potential design/build contractors have been developed. For reasons similar to the adult trap, the start date for hatchery construction has been pushed back one year from the original accelerated schedule. The Upper Baker Hatchery request for proposals will go out the end of June to the following design build teams: McDougal/McMillen, MWH, ESC/Dahlgren, TetraTech/KCM/PCL. The responses will be due mid August. PSE will issue notice to proceed on the design in September and ask that 30% be due October 12 with two weeks for review. Then 60% design will be due December 14 with comments due 2nd week of January. And 90% will be due the end of February. The notice to proceed on construction will be issued April 2008 depending on License issuance and Forest Service SUP. SA Article 103 Adult Trap: Design of the adult trap is continuing. The 60% design (some elements of the design are in fact more advanced than 60%) is under review and comments are being discussed. R2 Resources is developing the design to 100%, projected to be at that level by the end of November 2007. Contract for construction is being developed. Beginning of construction is planned for August 2008. SA Article 104 Native Char Investigations: Presently on hold pending results of USFWS genetic analysis of juvenile char samples collected from the Upper Baker River and Sulphur Creek. This study is now being tracked by the Fish Passage Technical Workgroup to support SA Article 104. The 2006 field results were summarized at the January 9, 2007 ARG meeting (notes & handouts). SA Article 105 FSC: Field construction/assembly of the Upper Baker FSC began last February. The majority of the structural work is complete. The reservoir has raised and is near full pool and the FSC has been floating for several weeks and is secured to the end of the craneway pier. The ARG Status Report 4 June 12, 2007 primary pumps have arrived and are being moved to the site for test fitting and installation will occur later. The fish channel structure is being installed and should be completed in another two weeks. Screens installation should begin in mid-July. NTS construction will begin within the next two weeks on a series of rails of which it will be launched when complete as a whole unit. The forebay mooring and guide net anchors are complete. The stairway structure tower on the dam is complete and pouring of the concrete pad will occur next week. Additional detailed update of construction progress will be provided at the next Fish Passage Technical WG meeting on July 17th. The Biological Evaluation Study is presently underway, status of/or preliminary results are to be discussed at the next FPTWG meeting on July 17th. Other Aquatic SA Articles: Working Group activities on Settlement Articles 108, 109, 110 and 505 are on hold until license issuance or at least until a relatively confident date is determined for issuance. PSE has begun to develop conceptual outlines of management plans for Articles 109 (Large Woody Debris) and 505 (Aquatic Riparian Habitat). A conceptual draft outline for 505 was presented for discussion purposes to the Aquatic Riparian teamlet in February, comments were incorporated into the outline. If your interested in joining this group contact PSE’s Jacob Venard (425-462-3771). The Article 109 conceptual outline will be presented to the ARG when it is further developed.
