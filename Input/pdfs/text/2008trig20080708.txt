DECISIONS Quorum / Proxy: We agreed that a quorum is present today, and noted the following proxies:  Chris Danilson will represent Todd Wilbur Don Gay will represent The Nature Conservancy and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Bob Nelson will represent Patrick Goldsworthy (NCCC) Notification requirements were met, a quorum is present, and proxies have been noted, so we agreed that we can make decisions today. Note that this is the public version of the meeting notes (which will be posted on the Baker relicensing web site). The confidential version (which includes confidential specific land owner/parcel information and approved acquisition funding amounts for the parcels) is available by request to Tony Fuchs. Decision #1: The TRIG authorizes PSE to enter into negotiations to purchase the X property using the initial acquisition funds. All unused funds will be carried over into the general elk land acquisition fund and will remain available for other pre- or post-license issuance elk land acquisition. If PSE purchases the X property and uses any remaining funds as directed by the TRIG, they will be released from any specific number of elk forage equivalency units under Phase One acquisition. Decision #2: The TRIG authorizes PSE to enter into negotiations to purchase the X property, including timber, for a cost of up to the approved amount (ask Tony for the amount approved). The TRIG adopted the above decisions by consensus of all members present.  Baker River Project Relicense Final Meeting Notes, 8/7/2008  FERC Project NO. 2150 Page 1 of 5    2008trig20080708.pdf en
