Route comments around to all if time permits. Lyn – Talk to Connie re: setting up Oct. BRICC meeting. (Since this meting, FERC has issued a schedule noting that the DEIS will be out in November.) Tony – Form Elk Acquisition Teamlet w/ members: Bob N., Chris M., Don G., Jason J., Todd W., Lauri V., Marty (Joetta of R-2 to do GIS support). Tony – Talk w/ Team Leaders of other groups to see that their re-vegetation plans acknowledge that, on federal lands, native plants should be “locally-derived.” Marty – Plan to bring the TRMP on a laptop w/ projector to the October 13 TRIG meeting. REVIEW RECENT BRICC ACTIVITIES Lyn let the group know that the BRICC (Baker River Interim Coordinating Committee) has not met since June because we are still awaiting the DEIS from FERC. Steve Hawking of FERC is seeking permission to share a timeline with us. The 30-day comment period will begin when the DEIS is issued. Lou Ellyn informed us that Lewis received their DEIS from FERC on Wednesday, September 21. That may be an indication that FERC will issue ours soon. LAND ACQUISITION UPDATE Tony reported that PSE has been in discussions with the RMEF. PSE has set up a contract (soon to be signed) with them. It is a consulting contract for RMEF to assist in discussions leading to the purchase of the desired parcel. If a purchase agreement can’t be negotiated, the next step would be to explore buying the development rights, a conservation easement or “life estate” (allowing them to live there while PSE owns the property). This group will be given a thorough update of the status of the negotiations before any papers are signed. The money budgeted is $1.2 million; RMEF services will come out of this fund, but PSE employee and attorney costs will not be charged to this fund. If, some years down the road or at the end of the license term, PSE decides to sell the land, RMEF has the right of first refusal. Tony led the group through a review of handout: 4.0 ELK HABITAT (Elk Chapter, Draft, September 19, 2005). The group discussed, in particular, our intent that the pre-acquisition habitat assessment be a oneday walk-through assessment. Kathy tracked our edits to this document; we will give Marty a copy of this handout with our edits neatly marked for him to incorporate. DISCUSSION OF NOXIOUS WEEDS RE: ACQUISITION OF NEW LANDS The group discussed the language for section 2.4 Evaluate New Parcels to be incorporated into the Project Boundary, including the review of handout: Email from Don Gay to Tony Fuchs, May 18, 2005 (with section 2.4 “Evaluate New Parcels to be incorporated into the Project Boundary” copied onto the back). The group discussed the level of weed treatment activities we would be responsible for on lands acquired under the terms of the settlement agreement. The group also discussed a number of considerations to be evaluated in advance of land acquisition (other land management objectives, treatment levels, costs, etc), as well as the considerations affecting the decision of whether or not to address specific weeds on any given piece of land (the weed’s classification, the degree to which the weed affects other resources and Baker River Project Relicense FERC Project NO. 2150 TRIG Final Meeting Notes, September 23, 2005  Page 2 of 4   other land management objectives, the parcel’s proximity to other resources, available budget, etc.). Kathy will adjust the language of this section to reflect the concerns brought up during today’s discussion. Further review of this article will be done when Marty sends out the TRMP draft (which we will discuss again during out meeting October 13). UPDATE OF TRMP REVIEW Tony requested that the group review the draft TRMP and prepare comments for discussion at the October 13 meeting. Route comments around to all if time permits. USE OF NATIVE PLANTS Wherever the TRMP refers to re-vegetate with native plants, it means “locally-derived” native plants (on federal lands). Off of Forest Service lands, we would use appropriate native plants or desirable nonnative species as appropriate to the site. SPECIES-SPECIFIC PLANS A set of appendices are being developed to deal with these. NEXT STEPS Marty will distribute the next TRMP draft by September 29th so the TRIG can meet again October 13th (sole item for the agenda: TRMP review) and have a “final” draft TRMP out by the end of November.
