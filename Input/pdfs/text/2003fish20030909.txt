Technical Memos/Reports Distributed  Filename: 090903 draft minutes.doc  Page 1 of 4   The items distributed and reviewed at the meeting were: 09/09/03 agenda (PSE), 07/24/03 draft meeting minutes (PSE), updated long-term schedule (PSE), Downstream Fish Passage Performance Standards Proposal (PSE), 1995 NMFS criteria (MWH), 2003 Draft NMFS criteria (MWH), BAG memo regarding FSC Capacity (BAG). Review Agenda, Minutes & Action Items Minutes from the July 24 meeting were distributed and action items reviewed: Verretto <ad> Check availability of Baker Lodge for March 8-9, 2004 passage and technical design meetings <ad> Completed. Group <ad> Submit comments via Livelink on updated document tracking memo. <ad> Ongoing Verretto & Welch <ad> Do future copies double-sided, where possible. <ad> Ongoing. Nick asked the group to review the minutes and submit comments via Livelink to capture them in the record. Review of BAG memo regarding flow through the FSC <ad> hydraulic capacity The BAG met via conference call July 30th and agreed on the phased approach of the FSC and on the hydraulic capacity. The FSC will start at 500 cfs and be "turned up" and tested during the first year of operation to 1,000 cfs (the BAG recognizes that NMFS criteria will be temporarily violated during this testing phase). Based on results of the test, the decision will be made whether to convert the FSC to 1,000 cfs to meet criteria. If collection effectiveness of the 500 cfs capacity FSC approaches the desired results, "tweaking" will occur to determine whether improvements can be made to match the effectiveness of the 1000 cfs FSC. The BAG agreed that maximum installed FSC capacity shall be 1000 cfs if performance of the 500 cfs unit isn't acceptable. Acclimation Facilities and Stress Relief Ponds The group discussed when/how to incorporate stress relief ponds and acclimation facilities. Size of the acclimation facilities must be estimated for the settlement agreement, but design won't start until 2005. Nick will take a look at data and estimate potential size <ad> approximately 200,000 fish (roughly triple the size). Size escalation will occur over observed numbers to accommodate expected increases in facility effectiveness, run size, seeding at Upper and Lower Baker, 48-hr. holding time, separation of daily transport groups, and possibly other factors. NMFS performance standards <ad> comparison of old and new draft Ray Eldridge highlighted several examples of the new NMFS criteria where the proposed Baker River Downstream facilities will meet or exceed the NMFS standard criteria. The synopsis of the discussion was that the FSC design is on target to comply with most of the criteria. Performance standards and settlement agreement article development Lengthy discussion occurred involving the settlement agreement language. Some of the points covered were: upstream standards verification using FTOT criteria (monitor for post-handling injury and mortality, monitor trap ops for descaling & bruising, etc) <ad> Nick will update and send to Steve; Gary Sprague noted that there is a note in the upstream passage section noting the possibility of having another agency operate the upstream passage facility (the same note should be added to the downstream passage section); Stan noted that he would like to see the outside entrance velocities and acceleration criteria specified in the settlement <ad> it was decided that they would be included in the prescription criteria and in the 30% design memo; Schedule overview & technical design mtgs. agenda Nick reviewed the upcoming technical design meetings and the long-term schedule. Downstream Passage Facility Site Visits The field trip is scheduled for October 29-31, 2003. The following sites will be visited (tentative): October 29 <ad> Wells Dam, Rocky Reach Dam  Filename: 090903 draft minutes.doc  Page 2 of 4   October 30 <ad> Lower Granite Dam, Wanapum Dam October 31 <ad> Bonneville Dam  Preliminary schedules were verified with each participant. More information will follow at the October 15 meeting.  Meeting Evaluation & Assignments Review The group elected to forego the opportunity to evaluate the meeting.

Participants: Stan Walsh SSC Jim Stow USFWS Ed Meyer NOAA Steve Fransen NOAA Gary Sprague WDFW Note: These notes have not yet been reviewed by the participants. The new floating surface collectors for the Baker River Project should be designed and built to: 1) Meet criteria (screening, attraction, trapping, etc.) at a flow of 500 cfs, with the capability of increasing flow up to 1,000 cfs. 2) In the first year be able to physically and biologically test the facility at 500 cfs and 1,000 cfs. 3) Depending on the results of the testing, add a section on to the front of the surface collector to test different entrance configurations. It may be necessary to use flows above 500 cfs to keep certain variables constant (e.g. entrance velocities) 4) Depending on results, expand the facility to meet criteria at a flow of 1,000 cfs. 5) Modify and test configuration of entrance of 1,000 cfs floating surface collector. The testing and modification schedule will need further discussion. We will need to identify all of the variables that need to be tested, before we can finalize the testing order and schedule. There is a desire to test multiple variables within a single migration season. For example, using acoustic tags we can observe differences in fish behavior between 500 cfs and 1,000 cfs.    2003fish20030909.pdf en
